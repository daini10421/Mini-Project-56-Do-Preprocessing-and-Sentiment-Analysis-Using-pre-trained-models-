2023 Community feedback loop results,"Hi members of r/diabetes 👋

**TL;DR**
We got some feedback from the community. Overall responses were positive but we also have some points where we can improve.
**/TL;DR**

A while ago, we joined the Reddit Feedback Loop initiative in an attempt to learn more about what you think about the community and our moderation of it. For this, Reddit selected a bunch of people who’ve visited the community or have done so in the past and invited them to fill out a survey.

The pool of invited participants was very varied and included daily participants as well as lurkers, and even users who had previously been banned.

Questions ranged from rating the community on a scale from “very dissatisfied” - “very satisfied” to open-ended questions where the participant could provide detailed feedback about their experience here. Of course, Reddit anonymized all the responses and removed harassing content before sending it our way.

I’m happy to report that Reddit has had to remove not a single response for being harmful or harassing <3.

In this post, I’d like to present some positive stats, some points where we could improve, and respond to a few specific answers.

## Positive stats 

Let’s start off with some statistics that we’re happy with!

- 79% of respondents are satisfied with our community. 
- 69% of respondents agree that our community helps them fulfil their needs.
- 85% of respondents agree that the rules are clear and easy to understand.
- 79% of respondents trust that we make decisions that benefit the community.
- 91% of respondents feel that people generally behave appropriately.
- Nobody reported that they feel unsafe in our community.

## Points of improvement

- Many of the respondents report seeing a lot of medical questions.
- Some respondents think the posts are messy and could do with some additional filtering.
- 7% of respondents report seeing harmful content more than once per week.

## Specific responses

I’d like to specifically respond to several concerns or remarks we got.

###Too much mixing of type 1 and type 2 (and similar concerns)

I’m sorry you feel that the distinction between type 1 and type 2 is unclear. We’ve made efforts to clear this up by letting people select their own flair and also adding flairs to posts. However, some of the respondents say that they want us to pick a type and only allow that here.

We will not exclude any diabetic from this community. There already exist type-specific subreddits which are great places for such discussions. We believe that the shared experience of diabetes also deserves a place.

###I still see a lot of posts that break the “No asking for a diagnosis” rule

Unfortunately, many people who are anxious about their health don’t take the time to read our rules before posting. We try to remove these posts as soon as we see them, and have recently expanded the moderation team to help with this.

The best way to help us deal with rule-breaking posts is always using the report button. This makes a post show up in our moderation tools so we can quickly respond.

###We need more moderators

We’ve recently added two new moderators to the team and now have better coverage in different timezones. Hopefully this has already addressed the issue.

###The theme could be polished

Please [message us](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/diabetes) if you want to help out.

###Please get rid of political content

⚠️opinion alert⚠️ there shouldn’t be a need to discuss diabetes-related politics because diabetes care shouldn’t be a political subject. 

Unfortunately, politics can have large effects on diabetes care. I can recall a (somewhat) recent example [about the $35 insulin bill](https://reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/wjvt6e/mega_thread_35_insulin_bill/). This was the first time we had to deal with such a large political discussion in our subreddit and honestly I don’t think we handled it very well.

However, simply banning all political discussions doesn’t help promote a fair and honest discussion of very important topics. Some people use Reddit to get their news, and something this important shouldn’t be hidden.

In the future, I believe that we should continue to allow political discussions so long as everyone remains civil. We’re not here to moderate what people believe or how they vote, only how they talk to others.

### Please add a “Vent” or “Rant” tag so I can filter it out

I can’t believe we hadn’t thought of this before. I’ve added the tag now :)

There were a lot of requests for very specific flairs. If you believe that we’re missing an important flair, please let us know in the comments here or by [messaging the moderators](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/diabetes).

### Please moderate people blaming type two’s for their condition better

It sucks that people still believe that T2’s have done this to themselves. It’s against the rules of our community and we remove any such posts. 
If you see someone who does blame anyone for their condition, please report the post so that we can remove it.

## That's it!

That's it for our response :) If you brought something up in the survey that I didn't mention, please know that we did look through the responses!

Of course, you're welcome to comment below or [message us](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/diabetes) if you have any concerns.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/13qfej4/2023_community_feedback_loop_results/,[removed]

It was an oddly quiet day that day and after I served a customer I noticed that there were no customers coming to my till so I checked my blood sugar. I have a Dexcom G6 but I felt weird and suspected my blood sugar was high and that I had ketones even though my Dexcom said 7.4, so I took out my testing kit from my cross-body bag and tested my blood sugar. The glucose meter said 18.1 (as I had thought) so I pulled out a ketone test strip and started to test my ketones, when I saw a customer coming to my till when I had blood on my finger so I finished testing and I had ketones. I looked up after testing and said hello to an older lady (around 60 years old) when she stared at my testing kit with a disgusted face and said, “Can you really not wait to do that until your break? I have a phobia of blood and looking at that makes me feel faint, have some decency”. I explained to her that I am diabetic and felt weird and couldn’t wait until my next break (which was in two hours), I continued to explain that I am sorry and did not see her coming and that if I did, I would have waited until I had served her. She started to explain how the only reason I had to do that was because of my unhealthy habits and that kids these days (I am a 18yo female) need to start taking care of themselves more. I started to explain that I am type one diabetic and that T1D is not caused due to unhealthy lifestyle, she then cut me off and said “Look, I know you’re passionate about this or whatever, but I really don’t care and your manager will be told about your rudeness”. I sighed and served the customer (still trying to stay calm and trying to not be rude), I finished serving her and she took her shopping; said “Kids these days” and walked off. 

I looked over at my water bottle and got up to go fill it up when the woman looked back at me standing up and said “See, you are going on your break, stop being a bitch and keep your health issues out of the work place!”.

I ignored her and went on with my day. It’s one of those things you just have to deal with but it really makes you feel like a horrible person :/"

A month later, I’m at 205 and my cholesterol is 135 and my triglycerides are at 140.  All because my BG has stabilized.  He starts going off on how I need to lose more weight and wants to put me on a statin.  

I switched doctors.  I’m not taking a fucking statin when my cholesterol numbers are well within normal and my arteries have no blockage.  I’m within 10 lbs of my goal weight and have lost 150 lbs in the past 3 years. Fuck him and his script.  He’s the one who fucked up by not getting an antibody test to see if I was T1."

Since I need those meds or I might complete a suicide attempt, are you suggesting I go off of them in order to lose the weight? Should I chose between my bmi or my mental health? What do you suggest?

The thing is, doctors place responsibility on the patient (sometimes deservedly so) for literally everything and they don’t have the entire picture. This is a way of handing him some responsibility instead of taking all the “blame” for a very well known side effect of all kinds of psychiatric meds. Bring them into the decisions you have to make for your entire health and well-being not just what he sees you for."

I think a lot of the time the thinking is that even if your extra weight hasn't caught up to you yet, it will eventually. 

But congratulations on the healthy changes you have made! You've done your body a world of good even if you haven't lost weight. There are certainly unhealthy thin people out there who could learn from your diet and your exercise regime. But ultimately, if you are interested in losing weight, you need to contend with the fact that you can even overeat healthy food which leads to staying overweight. Trust me, I could eat 2500 calories of lean meat, nuts, veggies, and fruit everyday if I didn't track my calories to stop myself (and if fruit didn't have so many carbs 😢). 

But if you aren't interested in losing weight, you could maybe try a different doctor. They might still harp on about the weight because it's bad for you medically, but they may be willing to mention it once and be complacent with that. 

Also, 800 calories would be atrociously low. Keep in mind that while doctors may know how bad extra weight is, they don't necessarily have good advice on how to take it off. If you are interested in losing weight, I can recommend a few subreddits that helped me lose 45 lbs safely and reasonably. But I don't want to overstep if that's not your goal."

All every diet I've ever been on has done is increase the weight my body wants to be.  Sure, I lose a few pounds, and then, while still following the diet, my body will stop losing weight, and then promptly put all the pounds back on, and often more.  

The only time I've successfully lost weight was by adding calories.   Yes, I ate more, and I lost weight.

I've started replying to doctors with ""I'm not going to go on a diet or try to lose weight until someone can explain to me why, for me, trying to lose weight always results in gaining weight.  I don't want to be any heavier than I am, and after numerous attempts I'm now 100 lbs heavier than I was before I started trying"".  I usually say that if they'd like to refer me to a specialist who is going to be able to figure out why, for me, reducing calories usually results in my body converting more energy to fat, then I'm all ears.  That usually shuts them up, as they don't have an answer for that.

The medical profession needs to get beyond the 'all people who are overweight are overeating"" and treat obesity like they do blood pressure.  If reducing calories doesn't work, there needs to be a second and third line treatment instead of just saying 'you must be eating too many calories"".  

As I learn more about the way the body works wth  various feedback methods, I'm becoming more and more convinced that my body in particular has something broken in the ""we need to store this energy as fat"" feedback mechanism..  that is, whatever hormones my body uses to determine that I'm underweight and needs more body fat is broken and needs some sort of medicine to break this feedback.   I.E. some sort of ""receptor antagonist"" or similar.

We have metformin and a whole bunch of other medicines for diabetes.  We have beta blockers and diuretics and others for blood pressure.   But for obesity it seems like we're being limited to methods to reduce intake, (willpower, gastric bypass, appetite suppressors) and have nothing that interferes with your body's ability to convert energy to fat or accelerates your body's ability to burn the fat off for those people reduce their calorie intake and don't see a corresponding loss of weight."

Every diabetic over 40 years is recommended to be on statins regardless of their current cholesterol level and assuming no atherosclerotic CVD. It should also be noted a CAC score of 0 does not mean no blockage as soft plaque isn’t included or measured in a standard CAC scoring

“ For patients with diabetes aged 40–75 years without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, use moderate-intensity statin therapy in addition to lifestyle therapy. ”

Dropping your calories signals to your metabolism that you're entering a period where less food is available so it slows, making it more difficult to lose weight.


Pay attention to where your calories are coming from. It is much harder to turn protein into fat (this logic goes for glucose as well). Keep your carb and fat counts as low as possible (you still need both to function) and try to stay active."

Weight loss can lower BMR but calories out includes your BMR. Someone who weighs 300lb will have a higher BMR than someone who weighs 150lb because a bigger body requires more energy to keep up and running. Eating fewer calories than you burn will always result in weight loss because you can’t produce energy from nothing. No one gains weight while stranded in the wilderness without food

He shared this ""video"" on facebook, I saw it and asked him how he could ""share that crap"" and now  he is upset with me because it's not crap?!?!?

Initially I was diagnosed as LADA or type 1.5 but recently at the ripe old age of 67 I have been re-diagnosed as type 1.  A week ago hubby was discussing an amazon order with me about ""celtic salt""?  I had no clue about it, so I asked him how expensive was it .... 36 bucks a pound  YIKES.  I asked why do you want to buy such expensive salt.... he replied because it can cure your diabetes.  Then today he shared this video on Facebook about how ""diabetes is a scam and can be cured""  SIGHING  He is beginning to get on my last nerve"

Spouses can be so…..complex in their thought processes! DH is educated (he’s an engineer), but sometimes his common sense switch sticks in the OFF position (IMO). I had to remind him that the liver/glucose function works much better in people whose pancreas still works properly and is able to hit the OFF switch on insulin production when the glucose starts to drop- I’m MDI, so my body has to deal with the higher level of insulin already in my system without the benefit of an OFF switch (hence the juice and fruit chews). He gets grouchy when I “diabetes-splain” it to him. I have a theory that they’re trying to be supportive in their own….weird….way, but ultimately this disease is something that only a diabetic can truly understand."

Looping or Tslim?,"hello everyone :)

saw my endo today and she saw how much i've been struggling with my diabetes and told me i should deff switch to a hybrid loop. she also told me she would fully support me if i chose to go the diy looping way. i admit, i do know of diy looping but that is pretty much it. i am positive i wil be able to figure it out but:

my question to you all is, is custom diy really so much better than let's say the tandem t:slim2? i was just gonna go for the tslim but after hearing what my endo said i am not so sure anymore. 

also, i am currently using the omnipod dash, that system is not loopable, is it?

It's harder to set up but it is pretty much better in every other respect, yeah. It's much more customizable, more regularly updated, has more functionality etc.

Yes the dash is loopable with a DIY loop. Here's a good place to start if you want to learn more: https://www.loopandlearn.org"

I just really like having an extra one in case of something just like this. I think I had 3 fail right in a row a few months ago but I've had good luck since then. There's always that tense time while you're waiting for your first reading to see if it actually works and then you gotta hope your readings aren't ridiculously far off. It is such a big giant pain.

Blood sugar spike after eating + exercise?,"My usual ranges after eating are 5.8-7.1. I tend to come down after an hour or two, even after eating more carbs than intended and with or without exercise. Usually I also get my exercise in before eating and give some time in between.

Checked sugars. 12.2. I freaked. I haven’t had a reading that high since I started measuring. I measured a minute later just to be sure and got a 10.0 instead.

Many of these responses are glib, compassion less and self aggrandizing.  This community can and should do better!  
It really doesn’t matter how you feel, what you would do, or what generation the OP is from.  What matters is that the OP is FEELING something and struggling with those feelings.  Stop acting like the answer to navigating and thriving this disease is easily found on a Hallmark card.  Everyone is different, everyone has a different support system and everyone responds to trauma uniquely.  I’m a woman who had two pregnancies with this disease, one stillborn and one live full term child.  If you are a man with type 1, you couldn’t even begin to understand what that was like dealing with.  If you are a person who was lucky enough to have your dream work well with your disease, you cannot understand what the OP is feeling.  What to the actual fu*k taking about “the problem with this generation and everyone gets a trophy”?  Seriously? The life alterations, emotional and financial stress and limitations of this disease for some can be brutal.  Good for you if it isn’t but if you can’t be encouraging or understanding of where someone is at emotionally , stfu."

One, is to embrace diabetes. Do whatever you need to do in order to not let the tasks bother you. Injections? Pump? Carb counting? Don't let it bother you. It's just something you do now. The anger and frustration will *always* make it harder for you to care for yourself and you will always lose that battle. Not to mention stress hormones make you more insulin resistant. 

There are resources. Retroactive health care? Marks marine pharmacy to import insulin on the cheap. Yes, it sucks but the truth is, overcoming diabetes and giving yourself the best care you can is hugely a mental battle. You're not alone in this, maybe you need a therapist or maybe some hard introspection. You DO NOT want complications to be the wake up call because honestly, they make diabetes look like ez mode - and if you think it's hell on earth then you absolutely do not want to get to the complications phase. 

It doesn't need to be this way. It can be so much easier and you can lead a nearly normal life - just focus on championing that mental battle and finding the resources to get your supplies. 

You can do it."

Focus on working to have a positive outlook on life (and note that this is *not* a suggestion to ""just stop being depressed"") and changing what you can change.

I guess I'm fortunate that I like to drink coffee black and tea either plain or with a bit of lemon.  That being said, I try not to use a lot of sweeteners but I sometimes use monk fruit and also allulose for substitutes.  I agree with you that most of  the artificial sweeteners have an off-taste, sometimes metallic, and also sometimes bitter, but a lot of that depends upon how much is used.  It's definitely NOT a 1:1 substitute ratio.

I will mostly use fruit.  For example, for yogurt I'll put in some lemon zest and a bit of vanilla, and I think it's wonderful.  Or maybe I'll add a teaspoon of jam to a cup of greek yogurt, rather than buy the fruity crap from the stores.  

For oatmeal, likewise vanilla and cinnamon add a nice flavor, or a teaspoon of jam with a bit of vanilla is also nice.  

You might have to try several before you find the combo you like."

I’ve tried stevia in the raw and it had very little sweetening and it tasted more like a sweet aftertaste. It got pretty bitter when baking with it. I would imagine coffee does the same thing to it.

I’ve tried swerve and it’s a little sweeter but still not anything close to real sugar.

I got diagnosed at 7. It's definitely not as bad as you think though, a CGM is the first and most important step. I've seen more Dr.s than I can remember and not a single one knew MY diabetes. Everybody handles food differently with insulin. You'll have to learn how she handles it. As for all day snacks, there's a ton of foods we can eat that won't mess with her BG. Even then, t1 can literally eat anything regular ppl eat. We just have to take insulin for it. Good blood sugars come from healthy eating so as long as you make the change with her it'll only be better for you both. And breads, starchy foods... they the devil lol and rice is the kingdom he lives in."

Then a little later try for a closed loop pump. This will help you guys both a whole bunch.

If she really likes to snack a lot she can have snacks she just needs to bolus. If you want to avoid stacking/giving a lot of insulin try some low carbs things. Veggies, nuts, and cheese are good. I’m sure you can also find other treats with lower carbs. Try to incorporate protein and fiber into meal times so she feels fuller for longer. 

Another quick thing is don’t stress over highs and lows a whole lot either. She’s only 4 and T1D is very exhausting. It doesn’t do anyone any good to freak out over every mistake. Remember kid first, diabetic second!

T1D takes a lot, and I mean A LOT of learning/trial and error. Don’t make her or yourself feel too bad over a high or low. Obviously the goal is to be in range but I don’t let that restrict me from having fun, like birthday parties and vacations. Just try your best to manage. 

And I can’t say that there wont be extremely frustrating moments, it does get a little better. Ask any questions you have this is a good community!"

For example actrapid spikes before the first hour after injection, but it keeps running for about 8 hours. That means that you want to eat a big meal like lunch in that first hour, but if you dose it correctly you can give her a snack on that winddown period.

Also, if you set up food times, I had breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner, night snack, as a child, she will get used to it and her hunger will adjust. This works for non diabetics as well, your body gets hungry when expecting to eat."

It’s basically all the information I wanted to have at diagnosis, but I didn’t have access to an endocrinologist/diabetes team to ask my questions so I had to research them myself. 

It’s not child specific, and I like researching, I’m not a medical professional, but I’m happy to send you a copy if you’d like.

I’d recommend reading the book “Kids First, Diabetes Second” by Leighanne Calentine. It’s a great read, written by a mother of a child with T1D. The only complaint I have is that it is USA-specific in some parts (I have issues with this only because I am not from the USA, so those parts I skipped over.)

Otherwise, I would recommend low-carb/no-carb snacks for now. Cheese and cherry tomatoes, cucumber or carrot sticks, etc.

Once you start carb counting, not fixed doses you can reintroduce the snacks as her blood sugar levels start normalising.

…

My biggest pieces of advice would be to look at blood sugar as a number and not anything more. It’s not good or bad, just data to inform you of what you need to be doing next. 

And don’t be too hard on yourself- there are 42 known factors that affect blood sugar and insulin sensitivity/resistance. You can’t control all of them, sometimes this disease has a mind of its own. Just do your best."

My kid is also a grazer and we have got a strong game for free foods (foods under 10g in carbs)

Cheese sticks, SF jello/popsicles, Cucumbers 
Peppers with cream cheese, Quest chips, Pickles, Deli meat roll ups, Serving of nuts. 

Otherwise, dose for what she wants to eat! 

If your child isn’t responding to insulin therapy you should call the endo back to advocate for those highs to be managed. Then prepare for the infamous “honeymoon” when her body gets insulin and then thinks it can make some again on its own. We explained to our kiddo it was like a flickering light bulb. 

CGM if you can afford it. Dexcom has been a lifesaver for us and also ASK about Omnipod 5 or a closed loop pump to learn sooner than later. MDI burnout is a real thing. We waited 2 years (our daughter wasn’t ready) but the transition has taken so much labor out of managing her diabetes. This disease is fluid and versatile remember nothing is your “fault” this is an autoimmune disease that simply happens.

Exercise helps high blood sugar! We do dancing games, and hot showers help our kids insulin uptake too! Does your daughter enjoy being active? Encourage that if her sugar is high. Drinking water helps too!  Also remember a multitude of emotions and factors can impact blood sugar. Biggest lesson I have learned is that the number is just portion of info which helps you make the next decision.

Learn to pack up leftovers with the carbs second.

Apples are fairly low carb, especially compared to bananas. They can be a good snack. Banana you have to bolus like the moment she starts eating.  If you have a slower insulin, maybe a 5 or 10 minute prebolus. 


***

It's hard at this age. She's so small that it can be hard to dose properly. 

What bolus ratio? We were 1 unit per 30g of carbs. Correction ratio? We were 1 unit per 100 points if blood sugar above target of 150.

Example. 21g of Goldfish is 14g of carbs. (Half unit) B.G. was 250. (1 unit). We'd prebolus for 1.5 units.

***

If she has ketones in her urine she'll start to develop insulin resistance. Talk to your endo, they'll give you the ratio to increase insulin dosing, like x1.2 for moderate levels. Don't take my word on that one, talk to a professional."

We were both diagnosed at 5 y/o and my mom would stock up on affordable no/low carb snacks so that we could still eat when our  bg was high. frozen vegetables work just as well, and if you have a diabetes clinic in the area and can afford it, I suggest visiting their endo/paediatrician, and dietician/nutritionist. Make sure she is comfortable, because it’s really scary. My mom had given me a stuffed bear that also “had diabetes” and had felt patches where injections are acceptable. I strongly suggest getting a cgm, such as a dexcom or libre, and getting her on a pump whenever possible. cgm changed our lives, no more painful pokes or rough brown caul loses on our fingers. I would also make sure to meet with her teachers before she starts school, and give them the rundown. Also make sure to include a source of fibre and protein with every meal to help stabilize her blood sugar and hunger levels throughout the day. Good luck, and you’re doing a great job."

Honest questions about Diabetes and insulin scripts in the USA,"Hello. Obligatory: I'm jakethesnakebakecake and I have diabeetus.

I've had Type 1 for almost half a decade now. And it was a huge adjustment. I got diagnosed in my mid-twenties and really had to relearn how to live life. After many years I can finally say I'm mostly comfortable going out and doing just about anything I used to do, as long as I plan carefully ahead of time, but it has been a long journey to return to an almost completely ""normal"" life.

My background out of the way, I have some honest questions I'd love to know the answers to. I'm not sure there are answers, exactly, but I've been curious about these things since I first became diabetic and had to start wading through the quagmire that is the USA healthcare system.

**Question 1:** Why are all modern Insulins only obtainable with a doctor's script? Other Countries (Canada and Mexico for example) allow for modern insulins to be purchased over the counter. Walmart (in the USA) already sells older versions of insulin I can use in a pinch, but they're very difficult to get right and since they take so long to do anything I try to avoid them. So, why is it only the insulins I strongly prefer as a Type 1 that I can't get over the counter? What's the deal? Will that ever change?

**Question 2:** Why can't we obtain any type of CGM without a script? I would argue these devices are essential to good health and a ""normal"" lifestyle as a Type 1. Stopping to poke holes in your finger is not conducive to a fun and spontaneous life and tracking bg is tricky with traditional glucometers. But because I only get 2 CGM that last 14 days per 31 days, and they often don't work or fall off early, I am always short. To the point that I'm often completely without a CGM, and also completely unable to buy another without a long series of phone calls to very exhausted sounding people who will begrudgingly resend a script that my insurance company, knowing full well the insurance company will argue they don't need to pay because they already covered 30% of the two I bought earlier...

Will we ever be able to buy CGM without a script? I know it might be expensive, but considering my insurance barely does jack for covering them anyways I'd love to have the option.

**Question 3:** And last but not least, has there ever been consideration to stamping out a License or something, so we can just flash the ""I am diabetic, allow me to buy insulin"" card? Is that too crazy a concept for our society? I know the cure is only 5 years away but let's be real here. Once diabetic, it's sort of permanent. We will always need insulin. We should always have the ability to go and obtain a CGM. And yet there's miles of red-tape between us and what we need to live.

**Question 1:** Why are all modern Insulins only obtainable with a doctor's script? Other Countries (Canada and Mexico for example) allow for modern insulins to be purchased over the counter. Walmart (in the USA) already sells older versions of insulin I can use in a pinch, but they're very difficult to get right and since they take so long to do anything I try to avoid them. So, why is it only the insulins I strongly prefer as a Type 1 that I can't get over the counter? What's the deal? Will that ever change?

**Question 2:** Why can't we obtain any type of CGM without a script? I would argue these devices are essential to good health and a ""normal"" lifestyle as a Type 1. Stopping to poke holes in your finger is not conducive to a fun and spontaneous life and tracking bg is tricky with traditional glucometers. But because I only get 2 CGM that last 14 days per 31 days, and they often don't work or fall off early, I am always short. To the point that I'm often completely without a CGM, and also completely unable to buy another without a long series of phone calls to very exhausted sounding people who will begrudgingly resend a script that my insurance company, knowing full well the insurance company will argue they don't need to pay because they already covered 30% of the two I bought earlier...

Will we ever be able to buy CGM without a script? I know it might be expensive, but considering my insurance barely does jack for covering them anyways I'd love to have the option.

**Question 3:** And last but not least, has there ever been consideration to stamping out a License or something, so we can just flash the ""I am diabetic, allow me to buy insulin"" card? Is that too crazy a concept for our society? I know the cure is only 5 years away but let's be real here. Once diabetic, it's sort of permanent. We will always need insulin. We should always have the ability to go and obtain a CGM. And yet there's miles of red-tape between us and what we need to live. And I am seriously struggling to understand the logic supporting why this is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14veo3w/honest_questions_about_diabetes_and_insulin/,[deleted]

Even though, as someone else said, insulin isn't something that is really abused.  Besides diabetics and some very fringe illicit use in the body building world, it's not useful to anyone else.  It's not pain medicine.

2)  Why aren't you contacting the CGM manufacturer if you're having issues with them working properly and/or falling off?  They should replace them.  No need to buy more.

Yes, insulin should only be taken with the guidance of a doctor which is why we need a script for that.  CGMs can be bought directly on their respective website with or without a script because you don't really need any doctor to use them. 
And while we don't get a card like OP asks for always receiving insulin it's OK the way it is because I honestly don't even know all the available insulin brands and my doctor keeps me up to date on all the medication and tech available and suitable to me. 

While our network has its flaws I do like the choice we have with insurance companies and the treatment we have."

getting really great results with it, would like to be on it for a year while i consistently lose this weight. hopefully the effects don't fade from usage-tolerance.

it is only a tool, though. the main factor helping me is i've over years been working at evolving my lifestyle towards a more plant-based diet/lifestyle, proper sleep and rest, and moderated eating.  just a lot easier now to 'not slip up'. a couple weeks ago i 'binged' and had two slices of pizza for lunch, i was almost sick for the whole day. just one slice for me max!"

You can shorten it by one day if you feel like it's too weak. 

Be aware, if you reacted strongly to ozempic in the first weeks of 0.25 mg the jump to 0.5 mg can be rough. 

You can 1) go to 0.37 mg for a few weeks to ease into the new dosage or 2) stay with 0.25 mg but shorten the interval (like every 5 days for a few weeks and then every 4 days for a few weeks) or 3) split the dosage and inject 0.25 mg twice a week. 

3) is equal to the jump to 0.5 mg but the split eases the side effects a bit. 

Just pointing these out as possibilities. Dosages and titration are of course between you and your doctor. Mine gives me freedom to do as I please as long as I stay within my prescription (as I of course can't inject more than I have I my pens, and my prescription will only be renewed after 3 months). But as I was fairly sensitive to the drug, I experimented a bit with dosages and intervals. 

Right now doing 50 clicks every 5-6 days, which is close to 1 mg per week. I'm 7 months in."

The objective is to eat foods which digest slowly and raise your blood glucose slowly. By doing that, and spreading your eating across longer periods of time you are giving your insulin a longer time to convert your blood glucose to ATP.

Insulin will keep your blood glucose low if you don't put glucose into your blood faster than the insulin can keep up. You can do that by exercising more, slowing down your eating, and eating things that only digest slowly."

My mom is now Diabetic,"Hi guys my mom was just in the hospital yesterday for having high blood sugars. Unfortunately she had to get 2 rounds of fluids in her to get down to normal. She has been prescribed Metformin and will be seeing a primary physician coming up. But in the meantime I wanted to look for resources for her. I’ve done my own “research” and have a standard idea how dieting and balancing carbs work but I get conflicting information. Also my mom is mainly Spanish speaking and was wondering if there is someone on Facebook, Instagram, or TikTok that gives reliable information in Spanish for her. 

Thank you for reading and I appreciate that there is a community here for this. I will be reading through some post to get personal experiences from you guys.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14v23wf/my_mom_is_now_diabetic/,"Pretty sure all of the basic information is available en español via Google or YouTube. Just avoid anything promising you a cure, or anything dumb about cinnamon and supplements. Diabetes care is a combination of: food choices, physical activity, medication and testing/analysis.

We couldn't give any specifics ahead of her doctor's appointment, but her being in hospital and needing IV fluid means she was very dehydrated. The body has a ""homeostatic"" level it wants to keep blood glucose levels at. Blood glucose is measured in a couple of different measurements, so depending on where you are at, it will be: mg/dL or mmol/L. A normal blood glucose falls within a range of values. When fasted (not eating for several hours), it is expected to be between 75 and 99 mg/dL. And 2 hours after eating, it is expected to be below 140 mg/dL. Above 160-180 mg/dL, the glucose will be spilling out of the kidneys and into the urine, and the body will be trying to urinate out the excess glucose. Which causes dehydration.

There's a different test that gives a 3-month average, called an A1C or HbA1C, and it often is written as a % value: And normal A1C is around 5% more or less. The staff at the hospital may have run an A1C on her, if you wanted to look it up. 6.5% is considered diabetic which is not so good, and anything over 10% is really pretty serious, and causing damage. 

She can obtain a glucometer, which is a device that can test her glucose anytime she wants. In the US, you could get a prescription for a device and for refills of test strips; but you can also go to any Walmart or corner pharmacy and buy a matching kit, with a lancing device to draw a drop of blood from her fingertip. Walmart is the cheapest over-the-counter purchase. Insurers would require a prescription be written by the doctor for the insurer's preferred brand of testing equipment. It is an easy and quick test. And the reason people test themselves is to see where they are at, and to make decisions on how to bring it down.

Diabetes is basically a ""metabolic disease"" in which food comes in to be used for energy and building blocks. The food is mostly broken down to 3 macronutrients: proteins, fats and carbohydrates. The carbs are the primary driver of high glucose levels -- coming from plant sources by way of sugars and starches (which are chains of sugars). The problem with ""junk food"" is that it is mostly made up of sugars and starches that have been heavily processed. Meaning they take the plants and remove a lot of the fiber or they grind it up into a powder like flour or cornmeal, or rice or potatoes. And as soon as you stick it in your mouth it starts turning into sugars and glucose. So, there's a flood of glucose coming in faster than the diabetic's body can handle it.

So, don't drink sugary beverages at all if you want good glucose control. Avoid ""fruit juices"" and dried fruit, and even tropical fruit like bananas has lots of sugars and glucose in it. Concentrate more on farm and garden food, and less on processed food, less on the high carb fillers like bread, pasta, rice, potatoes, crusts, tortillas -- the ""white foods."" Protein is necessary for all diets for building structures, and will partially convert to glucose but at a lower and slower amount. Some fat is also necessary for structures and making hormones, but lots of fats can slow down the absorption of glucose.

Medication depends on the cause of the diabetes. And we cannot guess that. She would need a proper evaluation to determine that she does not have autoantibodies for Type 1; or that she is indeed ""insulin resistant"" which is the most common form of diabetes. There's other reasons, but the doctor is supposed to determine that. A primary/general physician may be enough for her care, but they are not always trained to know how to diagnose and distribute the proper medication. An endocrinologist is a specialist who looks at hormonal problems, which diabetes is because it mostly involves whether the person does not make enough of the hormone insulin, or if they cannot use the insulin properly.

Metformin is a common, inexpensive pill taken once or twice daily. It may cause some belly upset for the first month or so. It will slow down the release of stored glucose from the liver, and will kind of sensitize cells to open up more easily to accept the circulating glucose. Other medications might suppress appetite, or urinate out glucose or force the pancreas to make more insulin. Insulin injections are usually necessary if the person cannot make insulin (ie. Type 1 diabetes, or pancreatic damage), but for Type 2 may not be preferred because Type 2 are often making too much insulin already.

Physical activity/exercise uses up some of the stored glucose and then makes muscle cells more receptive to glucose, so maintaining muscle mass is a good idea, as is to get some daily movement -- walking is fine, as long as she is in a safe environment.

The problems of diabetes are numerous -- and there are immediate effects of high glucose (low energy, feeling hot, being cranky, slow thoughts, paresthesia in the nerves, and an achy kind of pain in different places, plus blurry vision. Long-term exposure to high glucose is much worse because it damages virtually every part of the body -- vascular damage, kidneys and eyes, nerve damage, joints become stiff and painful, changes to the skin and ability to sweat properly, and problems circulating the immune system properly, and depression and ""brain fog."" This happens because there's too many loose glucose molecules, and they are attaching themselves to places where they don't belong (glycation), and also swelling, messing up the lenses of the eye, the nerves that provide sensory feedback, that control gastric emptying and other organ functions, and ruins parts of the kidneys' ability to filter blood. 

Don't know what you are reading and seeing online -- most of the social media you listed isn't going to provide enough education, and there will be a lot differing opinions telling you their way is the best. The truth is that that there's more than one way to improve glucose -- and low-carb, or vegan, or carnivore ways of eating, intermittent fasting or the ""My Diabetes Plate"" method are all used by different people because they have individualized preferences and beliefs. You just pick from what you are seeing and reading, and give it a try if you want; and then test your glucose repeatedly over time to see if it is helpful. If not, then experiment with a different method. Absolute perfection isn't expected -- she has a life-long health condition, but it can be made much better with simple ideas: Don't eat junky food, don't overeat; move your muscles; drink water; work with the doctors to find appropriate amounts of appropriate medications; and test your own blood glucose and learn from the numbers. ""Eat to your meter."""

It's great that you're looking for resources to help her manage her condition. I can provide you with some general information about type 2 diabetes and offer suggestions for finding reliable resources in Spanish.  
  
Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition that affects how the body processes blood sugar (glucose). It is often managed through lifestyle changes, including a healthy diet, regular exercise, and medication if necessary. Balancing carbohydrates is an essential part of managing blood sugar levels for people with diabetes.  
  
When it comes to diet and balancing carbs, it's important to focus on whole, unprocessed foods, including fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Limiting the intake of sugary foods, refined carbohydrates, and unhealthy fats is also beneficial. It's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian who specializes in diabetes to get personalized advice and meal planning guidance.  
  
**In terms of finding reliable resources in Spanish, here are a few suggestions:**  
  
1. American Diabetes Association (ADA) - The ADA has a Spanish-language website (www.diabetes.org/es) that provides information, resources, and recipes for managing diabetes.  
  
2. Diabetes Hands Foundation (TuDiabetes.org) - This online community provides support and information for people with diabetes, including a Spanish-language section where your mom can connect with others and find helpful resources.  
  
3. Social media platforms - You can search for reputable diabetes educators, nutritionists, or healthcare professionals who provide reliable information in Spanish on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or TikTok. Some popular Spanish-speaking diabetes influencers include Laura Amador (@myhealthybalance), Carolina Ruiz (@caroruiznutrition), and Diabetes al Día (@diabetesaldiaweb). It's important to verify the credentials and expertise of the individuals you follow to ensure the information they provide is accurate and evidence-based.  
  
Remember, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and guidance specific to your mom's needs. They can provide accurate information and help create a management plan tailored to her condition.  
  
I hope this information is helpful, and I wish you and your mom all the best on this journey of managing her diabetes."

From an extension office employee who is considered an ""expert"" I found this: It would not really effect the safety of the product to my knowledge, but could effect the quality (change in taste or flavor, texture). I would not recommend using it in jams/jellies however.

My opinion would be to small batch experiment. What I'm reading is that allulose is 70% as sweet as sugar with no impact on blood sugar, so maybe small batch 50% sugar and 50% allulose in one or two pint small batches. That way a failure won't be too expensive. If you get the thickening you want, you can start reducing the sugar and increasing the allulose until you reach a break point. Even a ""failure"" doesn't have to be a failure though. Some of my mom's best failures were her best pancake syrups 😁. HTH"

Your question has more depth to it than you might realize as you bring up several topics: 

1. timing of meals after bolus
2. insulin on board
3. insulin to carb ratio
4. insulin correction factor
5. potential for insulin stacking (refer to insulin on board)

while not terribly complex, these are very fundamental concepts that every T1 diabetic should understand.  These topics have been covered a lot in this forum, so you might search for them. Also, these are great topics to discus withyour endocrinologist, who should explain them to you.  You can also search the internet for these topics.

Some people call taking additional insulin in that timeframe ""stacking insulin"" though the term is more commonly used for when you do a correction and then are impatient and correct again before the insulin is done bringing you down.

Anyway. The way I do it is I add another dose for the snack. Since you already have insulin working then, though, you may not need to wait the entire regular pre-bolus window. I've had varying experiences. Also depends on whether your bg is already on the way up from the meal, for example."

I threw up a day after my first dose (bad enough I called out of work) and have been mildly nauseous since. I can deal with the nausea it’s not bad enough to be a problem.

I’ve been dealing with insulin resistance for the last 5 or so years. I’ve been diabetic for over 30 years & this is the best my blood sugars have ever been. I’m quite happy with it.

"Laid off as T1 diabetic, what are my resources for health insurance / diabetic supplies","Hey, I’m a 30 year-old type 1 diabetic that just got laid off at the end of June and lost my health insurance. :( I’m a bit worried, considering the fact that diabetes supplies and insulin costs add up very quickly with no insurance. 

I live in NJ, but worked in NY and will be getting NYS unemployment soon, I believe the max per week currently is $504. (Waiting for the claim to be processed)

I have a Dexcom G6 CGM that uses 10 day sensors and a transmitter that I replace every 90 days. I also get an like 2-3 insulin vials (Novolog) for my insulin pump about every two-three weeks. The day before I got laid off I upgraded my pump to Tandem Slim, with a box of new supplies as well, but I might hold off on transferring my pump until I use up all the supplies from the old one before jumping to the new one.

Are there any resources specifically for type 1 diabetics? I don’t know where to go or where to apply for help. Like if there are any known diabetic programs or resources helping cover for diabetic supplies, or if I can apply for Medicaid, Medicare, marketplace health insurances to cover me at least until I can find my next job?

I know I also got offered COBRA but I’ve been hearing that it’s notoriously expensive, (waiting for the info packet that’s supposed to come in the mail within 14 days).

Second; I am in Washington state and when I was on state insurance (can’t remember if it’s Medicare or medicade) I went through a company called byram healthcare and had zero copay for pump, and supplies. Maybe Google them and give them a call to see what they can do? Their after hours customer service is terrible so make sure you call during their business hours. 

Another word of advice is to ask your doctor to write your prescription for more than what your tdd (total daily dose) that way you can have some insulin stock piled. With my insurance I have now I have a $35 copay for insulin and that doesn’t matter if it’s 1 Quik pen or 10 Quik pens, it’s $35 no matter the amount."

Explain the situation to your doc and they should prescribe more than usual. Also cobra for me was like 400 / month and i def had to dip into savings and used my leftover HSA funds. I just started a new job after six months of unemployment (laid off too). Worst case you can use a cheap glucometer and walmart insulin, but it wont come to that probably. Depending on insurance cost I'd recommend dexcom + insulin pens/syringes after you use your current pump supplies up. It may save you money. 

Oh! one more thing - I did this before being laid off but it helps. Extend your dexcom G6 sensor sessions by resetting the transmitter. I almost always go at least 20 days on each sensor. My method:

* attach sensor and transmitter like normal, use for 10 days
* once session ends, remove transmitter (google how) and place in microwave for at least 15 mins - obviously DON'T turn the microwave on during this time, you're just keeping the transmitter from connecting to the phone
* after 15+ mins, place transmitter back into sensor and begin new session. the same sensor code should work.
* rinse and repeat until sensor falls out or you want to change sites. I feel like longer sessions could lead to inaccuracy and site scarring but I haven't had much issue yet"

If you switch to Freestyle libre then you can get two sensors which are good for one month for $75 if you have insurance (Insurance provides a discount). Or if the insurance that you get covers it then you can get either type of sensor, dexcom or libre, and just pay your copay.

As for insulin, Lily pharmaceuticals provides any of their insulins for $35 a month. You just have to go to their website and download a discount card. It's free. So instead of NovoLog you would use humalog, which is essentially the same thing. And that's $35 a month regardless of how many vials per month you use.

The day before I got laid off I upgraded my pump to Tandem Slim, with a box of new supplies as well, but I might hold off on transferring my pump until I use up all the supplies from the old one before jumping to the new one.

Are there any resources specifically for type 1 diabetics? I don’t know where to go or where to apply for help. Like if there are any known diabetic programs or resources helping cover for diabetic supplies, or if I can apply for Medicaid, Medicare, marketplace health insurances to cover me at least until I can find my next job?

I know I also got offered COBRA but I’ve been hearing that it’s notoriously expensive, (waiting for the info packet that’s supposed to come in the mail within 14 days). But I’m not sure if I can realistically afford rent and pay for COBRA health insurance at the same time (if it is as expensive as $900-$1,000). If anyone has any suggestions/past experiences, it would be greatly appreciated, I’ve only had T1 diabetes for the last five years and this is my first time being diabetic/ laid off so I’m not sure if there are any helpful resources that I’m missing.

Also apply for food stamps and if you happen to have kids under 5 WIC. These programs are meant to help people in need in these exact types of situations to help until they get back on their feet.

Whoever you insulin manufacturer is, check their website for a prescription card. Also check good RX we get some of our scripts for much cheaper through there than our insurance."

They’re modified G6 transmitters that last 120+ days and they make your sensors last longer too. I started mine with a new sensor 17 days ago and it’s still going strong (and accurate)!

Lastly COBRA in my state was 3x the cost of the insurance it was sustaining/replacing. The costs of incur for non emergency treatment wouldn’t even add up to that. Don’t get COBRA, go get fresh new plan from healthcare.gov"

Thank you!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14uq70n/laid_off_as_t1_diabetic_what_are_my_resources_for/,"COBRA is really only worth it if you've got a relatively short gap between jobs to cover--it's very expensive, but if say you had a job lined up for next month, then I'd say to COBRA rather than be switching everything twice.

First option: Check NJ's Medicaid limits. The provider selection can be mediocre but the cost is unbeatable, aka free and almost no cost sharing. NJ is relatively generous so this is absolutely worth checking. 

Second: Get on the exchange that was posted on the thread. There are subsidies. Check the plans **carefully.** There are 4 tiers of plans. Most subsidies are calculated based on silver tier and you may have to choose silver to get these additional rebates. DO NOT GET BRONZE. Bronze has coverage limitations. Many exchange plans are restricted network so check that also. 

DO NOT

\- Get catastrophic coverage  
\- Fall for plans that do not have to meet ACA standards. Trump loosened them.   
\- Get ""short term"" coverage  
\- Fall for a ""health share""

***NONE OF THESE WILL COVER WHAT A T1 NEEDS.*** 

Stick to the exchange. You're unemployed and if you don't qualify for medicaid you should qualify for federal exchange subsidies."

If on a pump you can buy generic lispro for $20 a vial without insurance. You will need a coupon from GoodRx. Depends on how much you need, you'll pay $20-40/month

Same thing for Dexcom G6 with a GoodRx coupon. You can buy three sensors for $150 and a transmitter for $50. You can extend the life of your sensors by restarting them, usually twice as long without having major issues. So that should bring you down to $92 per month

If on multiple daily injections you can do NPH and regular insulin, which you can buy at Walmart. The only downside is you need to inject 30 min prior to meals. Those are $20 a vial each.

That's my survivor's guide to uninsured DM in the US hope it helps."

"Laid off as T1 diabetic, what are my resources for health insurance / diabetic supplies","Hey, I’m a 30 year-old type 1 diabetic that just got laid off at the end of June and lost my health insurance. :( I’m a bit worried, considering the fact that diabetes supplies and insulin costs add up very quickly with no insurance. 

I live in NJ, but worked in NY and will be getting NYS unemployment soon, I believe the max per week currently is $504. (Waiting for the claim to be processed)

I have a Dexcom G6 CGM that uses 10 day sensors and a transmitter that I replace every 90 days. I also get an like 2-3 insulin vials (Novolog) for my insulin pump about every two-three weeks. The day before I got laid off I upgraded my pump to Tandem Slim, with a box of new supplies as well, but I might hold off on transferring my pump until I use up all the supplies from the old one before jumping to the new one.

Are there any resources specifically for type 1 diabetics? I don’t know where to go or where to apply for help. Like if there are any known diabetic programs or resources helping cover for diabetic supplies, or if I can apply for Medicaid, Medicare, marketplace health insurances to cover me at least until I can find my next job?

Thank you!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14uq70n/laid_off_as_t1_diabetic_what_are_my_resources_for/,"Humalog takes *slightly* longer to start working vs Novalog (roughly an extra 5 minutes from the studies I've read, and about an hour extra to peak), so if OP is used to dosing while eating, they'll probably see a higher peak - I try to time my doses to coincide with when I'm plating my meal if I'm at home (I'm cooking for two, so plating takes a few minutes), or if I'm eating out, when I see the food coming. My insurance only covers Humalog (no Novolog), which is still worlds better than the Novo*lin* I was on before I got insurance again.

And I wish I'd known about Lilly's savings program earlier, I didn't hear about it until recently - I went 6 months on Novolin, with my sugar way out of control while dosing 150+ units a day at times (you can buy Novolin OTC at Walmart in most states). I'm on the generic version of Humalog now that I have insurance again, but it's still made by Lilly, just none of the Humalog branding (there's a small Lilly logo on the pens; same factory, same standards, just cheaper for my insurance bc there's no marketing behind the generic). 150+ regular units a day to less than 75 (including my long acting) is a total life changer."

All of mine except on my fingers (normal to need touch ups every 5 years or so on fingers) look just as vibrant as they did the day I got them.  The only issue I’ve ever had regarding diabetes and tattoos is they request I eat a meal so I don’t pass out, but my non-diabetic friends also get this recommendation so it may be universal vs diabetic specific.

Leave a review on the shops Google reviews, but absolutely don’t go back if they try to make it right. They just need to reprimand the artist for discrimination. Make sure to highlight why it’s okay for t1 and t2 diabetics with well controlled sugars to get ink like anyone else. Maybe also mention if it’s going to be a big deal going forward that the shop can request a doctors note “okaying” it before hand, instead of immediately denying services. A doctor shouldn’t have an issue writing that an A1c and insulin is good on labs, and it’s safe for folks to get inked knowing the potential risks involved (infection and allergic reaction)."

Others won't mind and will just explain that we heal slower than non diabetics and may recommend breaking up pieces into more, shorter sessions. Best of luck!"

Never have been denied. The artist will usually tend to tell me to keep an eye and that there is a possibility that I’ll take longer to heal. I’ve never had any trouble with this as I’ve found what works for me. Sounds like they just didn’t want to do a free tattoo. Edit: and to be completely honest I wasn’t perfectly controlled during most of my tattoos. I’d keep my levels perfect 3 days before and 3 after and I’d fall back into my ways. But still never had any issues healing

Fighting low blood sugar after being off insulin injections for over a month,"My doctor is guessing that I am Type 1.5, but there has not been an official diagnosis. She started me on 28 units of long acting insulin (decreasing down to zero units over the course of 2 months) and 2,000mg of Metformin daily. I did this for two months and now I am just on 2,000 mg of Metformin daily and have been without insulin injections for about 45 days now. 

Starting Friday, my blood sugar numbers have been phenomenal all of a sudden. Any spike is corrected quickly. I now go down into double digits whereas before Friday, my body did not want to ever go below 120 mg/dL.

However, now I am fighting lows. My numbers keep plummeting and I’ve dropped below 70 mg/dL 4 times in the last 48 hours and had to bring it back up. Why is my body all of a sudden going low without insulin injections? I thought Metformin wasn’t supposed to bring you low on it’s own? I’ve also been pounding carbs in order to keep myself from going low and my numbers spike, but then plummet right back down, even if I’m having proteins and fats with my carbs.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14v95nq/fighting_low_blood_sugar_after_being_off_insulin/,"You’re likely still in your honeymoon. Enjoy it, because you will eventually need insulin. What metformin does is it does bring your blood sugar down by stimulating your insulin production in your pancreas and reducing insulin resistance. That is probably why you’re seeing lows. Call your doctor and ask for some advice. They will likely make some adjustments to your meds, because you shouldn’t have to be eating straight carbs to keep your blood sugar up all the time."

My fave right now is Chocolove's Almonds & Sea Salt in Strong Dark Chocolate. It's not that dark - only 70%, but it's real candy and 1/3 of a bar is 13g of carbs. The darker you go, the lower the carbs. Anything below 70% is probably too sugary. 

Also be careful on those sugar-free products. They often have bulking agents that make them as high carb as the regular candy!"

One of the processes is usually two stages, the first one that starts with food entering the mouth and the 2nd one around peak time, 45 to 75 minutes after first bite, with an average of 60 minutes.  If I remember correctly, the first one is kicked in by the pituitary gland that’s near our brain and the 2nd I think is kicked in by the pancreas.

While they might match sometimes, it is unrealistic for them to read the same all the time. They’re both accurate (most of the time), as long as they’re within 20% of each other. Bear in mind, CGMs are notoriously inaccurate during the first 24-36 hours of beginning a new sensor session."

Blood meters are accurate within 15% with a MARD of around 5% compared to lab tests. 

CGMs (when functioning properly) are accurate within 20% with a MARD of 7-10% (varies by model and brand) compared to blood meters. 

MARD is telling you the average discrepancy from one method to the next. CGM MARD tells you the average % difference between it and a blood meter reading. Blood meter MARD tells you the average difference between it and a lab test."

You're not alone. All Measuring we do has both, what in my field is called, input and output lag. CGMs gives us the direction and impact factor at the cost of added latency.

My mom got diagnosed and I need help,"TLDR: questions in the end of the post 

My mom (53) had a stroke. 

Something was wrong with her face. We called ambulance. They didn't want to take her to the hospital but checked sugar and it was really high. 19, as I remember. We didn't actually know it was a stroke before she got to the hospital. 

At the hospital she was told she has type 2 disbetes and apparently has it for some time already (months if not years) . 

She is home now. She takes Metformin (500 in the morning, 1000 in the evening), Jardins, Glikazid and some other meds — all prescribed at hospital. 

My mom (and tbf all my family including me) doesn't have healthy relationships with food. So our family diet was always a mess with lots of sugars and carbs, fast/processed food - you name it. After mom's diagnose we are trying to change it.



So I have few questions. And I really appreciate any help because I feel overwhelmed with all that is happening. 

1. Food /diet 
Any good resources for diabetes (T2) friendly receipts? I want to cook meals that are tasty and appropriate for her new diet so she doesn't miss 'bad' food that much and wouldn't want to cheat diet. Because of some past issues, she feels bad when has food restrictions and my goal to minimize stress 

2. Any resources for ""new"" to diabetes? 

3. Anything you wished you knew earlier? 

4. What should I (person who takes care for her, managing doctors appointments, etc) should pay attention to?

As for eating, carbs are “addictive” and there’s no good way to come off of them imo. I think in some ways you have to just make yourself eat other food and then change your taste buds. Nothing is gonna give you a hit of endorphins like sugar and white flour, sad to say."
My mom got diagnosed and I need help,"TLDR: questions in the end of the post 

My mom (53) had a stroke. 

Something was wrong with her face. We called ambulance. They didn't want to take her to the hospital but checked sugar and it was really high. 19, as I remember. We didn't actually know it was a stroke before she got to the hospital. 

At the hospital she was told she has type 2 disbetes and apparently has it for some time already (months if not years) . 

She is home now. She takes Metformin (500 in the morning, 1000 in the evening), Jardins, Glikazid and some other meds — all prescribed at hospital. 

My mom (and tbf all my family including me) doesn't have healthy relationships with food. So our family diet was always a mess with lots of sugars and carbs, fast/processed food - you name it. After mom's diagnose we are trying to change it.



So I have few questions. And I really appreciate any help because I feel overwhelmed with all that is happening. 

1. Food /diet 
Any good resources for diabetes (T2) friendly receipts? I want to cook meals that are tasty and appropriate for her new diet so she doesn't miss 'bad' food that much and wouldn't want to cheat diet. Because of some past issues, she feels bad when has food restrictions and my goal to minimize stress 

2. Any resources for ""new"" to diabetes? 

3. Anything you wished you knew earlier? 

4. What should I (person who takes care for her, managing doctors appointments, etc) should pay attention to? 

Thank you and have a good day <3",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14uy1y8/my_mom_got_diagnosed_and_i_need_help/,"To avoid progression and complications, your mother will have to decide what she wants to do. Giving up carbohydrates is the the healthiest solution. Carbohydrate addiction is so deeply ingrained in us that giving them up feels like sacrilege. If she is unable to give up her carbohydrates, then she will need an insulin pusher or insulin. High BG levels will take a wrecking ball to your body. High insulin levels have a similar result."
overeating = longer high blood sugar levels?,"as the title says, does over eating mean that your body will be absorbing your food over a longer period and that means you will sustain a higher blood sugar level for longer ?

But what you are overeating. Usually when we talk about overeating, it’s with high fat or high carb or some other not so healthy food. I bet if you overeat salad (as long as it is a healthy salad that remains low fat and low carb ) you won’t have this problem.  Depending upon the type of sushi you eat, some of them have a high fat content. And if you overeat high fat foods , you’ll get a high blood sugar that will take longer to bring down."

If you overeat carbs, your blood sugar stays high until your body finishes processing. Simple carbs spike quickly. Complex carbs create a stream of glucose as the starches break down into simpler chains.

I think of stuff like potatoes as beetus bombs. Explosion of glucose followed by a fire that just keeps burning.

If you find yourself overeating in general, it might be time to look at your macros and get more fat and protein in your diet."

It is idiotic that insurance requires Meds. It's like saying you can't have a speedometer in your car unless you had a speeding accident. It is possible at least in theory to avoid having meds if you manage your blood sugar using a CGM. But you can't have a CGM to do it. That is neither a medically sensible nor an economically sensible decision. But I'm glad my pharmacist figured out it wasn't true. 

This is not the first time that my doctor's knowledge of the insurance was wrong. The pharmacist is your friend."

Pre-diabetes isn’t a “nothing’s wrong, stop soda” situation. It is still a type of metabolic disorder that needs to be taken seriously or else it can (will most likely) progress to type 2 diabetes. At this stage, some people can even prevent developing type 2, but more often than not, I hear of it being “treated” as an afterthought by doctors and patients alike.

I know for a fact too that medications are also prescribed to treat it because I have a friend who is pre-diabetic and has been taking Ozempic for the past year. His insurance also pays for it.

With that said, it is unfortunate in this era there are too many general practitioners out there who are clueless about treating people with diabetes or even pre-diabetes for that matter. I’m not going to write another thread detailing the gross incompetence I suffered at the hands of my former physician at diagnosis, but I will say that it left me shocked just how ignorant somebody with a medical doctorate can be about this class of diseases.

Don’t trust general practitioners. Go see an endocrinologist because this is their specialty and they will take things seriously, and a good one will even go to battle with insurance to get you the coverage you need."

It looked exactly like the regular freestyle Libre but didn’t pair with your phone or provide really time data.  It would simply log your blood sugar for ten days or so and then you’d go back to the doctor and they would download the data.

So all that to say, if you’re not diabetic yet and just want the info to help make some lifestyle changes, you might try this route.  The blood sugar data combined with ten days worth of detailed food, exercise and sleep logging would probably give you lots of insights.

When I first got my CGM, it was incredibly helpful to figure out all the different things I was doing that seemed minor at the time but had a big impact on my blood sugar."

I use the libre 2. 

My pcp said a requirement for her to write the rx was for her to want me to test 4x daily. I don't know if that is universal, just my experience. 

My insurance doesn't cover them. According to them, I am not diabetic enough (IE not on enough medications to justify needing one).

They are extremely helpful, especially for new diabetics/pre-diabetics. They help you see trends more easily than if you're just finger testing. 

For me, my pharmacy applies an Abbott coupon to my order, which provides me with two Libre 2 sensors for $75. Each sensor is expected to last 14 days, so this is a 28-day supply. 

In my opinion (if you use Libre sensors), if you don't intend on finger testing while using the sensors, then don't bother getting the Libre meter. It is $75 or so and was a waste of money for me. You can scan your sensor with your phone and save having to buy the unnecessary meter."

There are three types of Libre sensors. The 3 only requires your phone app is continuously monitoring so all you have to do is open the app and look at it. It will tell you if you're in your ""good"" range and what percentage for the last 24 hours. I haven't actually tried to see if it goes back farther. I know this is counter intuitive but I keep a paper log and write down my before and after meals (2 hours after) and what I ate to help track what I can and can't eat. I don't use it as much anymore, usually just when I'm eating something new.

The Libre 2 also has an app and you scan the sensor on your arm with your phone. I always found it to be a bit awkward.

The original Libre had a reader you needed to use.

The 2 and 3 don't need a reader, but my pharmacy kept insisting that the insurance company required me to have a prescription for that as well. I finally got it through to them that I was self pay and did not require the reader."

Thoughts on Heavenly Chocolate / Green Cola?,"Hi all,

As your aware recently been diagnosed and been trying to find alternatives to things I used to like to eat...I found Heavenly chocolate which is a alternative to the traditional chocolate you find in stores. No soya, less than 1 percent sugar in the whole bar, 30g of carbs for a full 80g bar. Does also include sucralose.

Green cola, again they state no preservatives and is sweetened using the stevia plant but also has sucralose.

It was only under the weight loss label that I was able to get access to any glp-1 type drugs because my insurance flat out rejects the possibility of a t2 drug making any improvement for bg control in t1's.

Before that there were other glp-1 type drugs such as
Trulicity, Bydureon, byetta, victoza, etc.

I lost 40lb since the end of Feb, maybe it was me fasting more often, or me reducing or eliminating carbs, or increasing activity, or not snacking as much.  Could I have done that without the wegovy, maybe, but fighting my appetite would've been harder.
 I would have had to stick strictly to keto/low carb to block out my appetite,  which isn't easy. The wegovy lets me have carbs without my appetite coming back so strongly, there's still urges but it's dialed down a lot, and my stomach actually signals its full instead of a bottomless pit that it was."

I made the switch to metformin and insulin after that. I'd much rather jab myself 4-5 times a day vs go through that horrid nausea again. And the lack of appetite... well, I'd eat maybe once a day (sometimes not for a couple of days) and just wound up really weak."

Nevermind...your day was worse.  It doesn't matter if I eat or not.  I see my Endo again in Sept, maybe sooner!  In closing, I nicknamed my glucose, Karen!

Supposedly Walmart's ReliOn meters and strips are pretty cheap, and they're NOT TrueMetrix (a TrueMetrix meter put me in the hospital twice, it was hilariously off, back to back readings were often 200+ points apart - a replacement has been pretty reliable in that it consistently reads about 20 points higher than my Contour Next meter).  Alternatively, Contour Next strips in a 70 pack are pretty cheap at Walmart and on Amazon ($24-26 on Amazon, $26-28 anywhere else except Walgreens and CVS), and even their highest end bluetooth meters are only $20 at Walmart (with strips, lancing device, lancets, and a case).

That extra water wakes me to go to the bathroom and I check my G6 for low or high sugar. I keep glucose tablets right next to my bed, and my G6 will wake me if I get too low. 

I do micro adjustments when I wake, taking little boluses or eat glucose tablets to adjust blood sugar. This is needed, for I am in ""Manual"" mode on the Medtronic pump which cannot read blood sugar from the G6.

Here’s the deal in as simple terms as I can put it: you had a high blood sugar for too long without insulin in your body which put you into keto-acidosis im guessing. That’s how you found out as many other type-1s do. Going forward, if you take insulin at regular intervals like you’re supposed to you shouldn’t go into acidosis in one night, not that it’s impossible though. A low blood sugar in the night on the other hand, if it gets too severe you will lose consciousness (aside from being asleep) and you may not be able to regain consciousness without someone else intervening on your behalf. You may go to sleep and never wake up i.e. the big forever sleep. Seeing as you’ll be on a heavy carb diet you may not have to worry about that too much but working out will also usually lead to lower blood sugars.

Should I be avoiding going to sleep with a high blood sugar?,First night home with diabetes.,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14tw35p/should_i_be_avoiding_going_to_sleep_with_a_high/,"Okay, well then, you are in recovery from very high levels, right? 

So,  need to expect to bring your levels down gradually over the next couple of weeks. There is a risk of trying for normal levels — 1) from not knowing how insulin acts in your body. 2) Rapid glucose reduction comes with a risk of edema and a small chance of causing nerve problems or eye problems. 

It seems counterintuitive, but if you were at like 400+ for a while, then 270 is better. So, no need to rush into getting perfect blood glucose. If you can safely work with your doctors to get below 200 mg/dL over the next week, that is like a reasonable first goal, and then whittling your way down toward normal over some weeks. Till you can understand your body, your medication, and your testing equipment. 

Low glucose happens because too much insulin is used for the situation. And the situation might be that your insulin:carb ratio is off, or you didn’t estimate the number of carbs, or you tried to pre-bolus for a meal but got distracted or were at a restaurant and the food took longer to come out; or maybe when you sit still 3 units of rapid is okay, but when you got up and took a walk, you plummeted unexpectedly. 

So, there’s a lot to learn. “High glucose” at the beginning is relative to where you were in the hospital. And also to your predictive abilities on avoiding lows. Sorry, it is complicated. Hope you are feeling a little better. 

Just FYI — they probably didn’t warn you that your vision might go a little wonky for a few weeks while the glucose dissipates from your eye lenses. And there is an odd phenomenon where people who are newly under control can have “false hypos” where their glucose is normal or even a bit high and they start feeling badly — panicky and low energy, simply because their bodies haven’t adjusted to being healthy again yet.

Don’t know what meds you have, or how often you can test, but you will be making adjustments over the next weeks. Perfection isn’t expected today (or ever, really), but better numbers are ahead. Sleep and learn more tomorrow, and one day at a time. Call or message your doctors if you can to ask your questions. People here are not allowed to give specific medical advice."

And the extra boost from the hypothesized classical conditioning (over baseline glucose level of carbohydrate which is high but maybe not as high as when your body expects it).

Also partbof conditioning is a generalization curve. The closer an experience is to the trajned situation the more response effect you can expect. Pita and naan are similar in a lot of ways so you should expect a similar response, for example. Burrito and bowl taste similar and smell similar so again some generalization (if classical conditioning applies to the pancreas).

Edit: went to look on Google Scholar and there are a few studies indicating glucose response can be conditioned. Here is 1 example although not quite what I hypothesize https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0166432899001928"

Motivation is tough with this. I sort of took care of myself for the first 10 years or so of my T1D diagnosis. I had an a1c in the 7s and 8s. I was in my 20s, no cares or worries, drank and ate wrong, I was there. Then it hit me, I could take care of myself and avoid the awful effects my poor attitude and lack of care would bring me. I went to my endo and got a CGM. Changed my insurance plan at work to help me afford then CGM and supplies. Started working out more, eating better, paying close attention to how my body reacted to food, stress, etc. Was it hard, hell yes. Do I have to work every single day at it, hell yes. Can I still have fun, drink alcohol, eat bad at times, and live my life to the fullest, hell yes. It’s hard, it’s a struggle, but it’s so worth it I promise you. I have an a1c now in the 5s consistently. I work so hard to make sure I’m around as long as I can be for my wife and daughter. You’ll find it, that motivation you’re lacking right now. Step 1 is just to start, however small. If it is as simple as checking your sugar once a day, great! Maybe it’s eating a salad and going for a walk, awesome! Put yourself into a new routine and suddenly you’ll see what you are capable of. Work with your doctors and therapist, they will be key to your success. Trust in yourself, you can do this. You can do this. You can do this. Best of luck to you, you’ll get this."

I'm sorry you're where you are now.  I don't know if anyone can point you in a direction that will bring you out of the darkness you're in. From where I am, it seems your depression is driving the bus right now, and that's not something I have had to deal with personally before.  

I'm certain that from where you are right now, it feels that your challenges are monolithic and insurmountable.  I promise, though, that they are not.

You're facing challenges that most people can't imagine.  It's going to be hard to beat these challenges, but you can do it. The old parable of ""how do you eat an elephant?"" comes to mind....  the answer is, of course,  ""one bite at a time.""

I was diagnosed at 17. I'm 51 now, and I have a wife and son. I still struggle nearly every day, but I'm still trying to be the best T1d I can be. 

I hope you continue to fight to be the best as well, and I'll send you some excess dharma to help speed your fight. I promise that you can do it and the end result will be worth it. 

Best,

Also, I have woken up in an ambulance TWICE from critical lows less than 20 mg/dL. By all rights I should be dead.

Not to be a dick, but I’m going to take the hard road: if you don’t turn your life around and CHOOSE to do better, you will either die WAY too early or start losing pieces of your body that you can’t get back and then die way too early.

Everybody has their own version of the worst situation, I went through mine and I STILL do, daily, but the other side of choosing to do better is a pretty awesome life. I was lucky and found a woman that fights for me to do better and listens when I need it, we have amazing kids, things are good. Life is worth it.

Bottom line: DIABETES SUCKS HAIRY BALLS AND WILL KILL YOU IF YOU LET IT. Pull yourself up so we can all tell you how well you’re doing when things start going right! Take a step, then another, then another. Soon enough you’ll look back and see how far you’ve come. It’s going to be uphill, but think of the victory it will be. Use your PAST depression as fuel and start ‘walking’.

DON’T LET THIS SHIT BEAT YOU, I guarantee you’re better than it is!!

Your post reminded so much of my step-daughter. She too was diagnosed at a young age and I know she had these feelings too. Her Dad worries that she's tired of her diabetes and that she doesn't want to deal with it anymore. She's a beautiful, bright and talented young woman. I want to see her succeed in her life. Her and her Dad went through some trauma before I came into the picture. I grew up with my Dad already diagnosed with Type II. I never saw her take any of the precautions that he did. She also had some other health issues and it was really hard for her to really take care of herself. Her Dad was a single parent and work took most of his time. She was a YA when I started dating her Dad. She had multiple trips to the ER for DKA and some when she went off to college. It scared us each time she went to the hospital. Both her Dad and I think she's in a better place living on her own and she's taking better care of managing her diabetes. We are both very happy and proud of her. I just got diagnosed with Type 2 earlier this year. I was disappointed but I think growing up with my Dad taking care of himself kind of prepared me. I had already switch to sugar free or sweeteners when I was a teen. I was still annoyed because I don't like sweets( hardly ate sweets that much), switched to milk alternatives, ate less meat more plant based, drank little to no soda and was practicing fasting for 2 years before being diagnosed. Just know that you are worth it. You are special to someone and you're never alone. It will be okay. Hugs. Take care OP."

I don’t know if this is like enabling of me or anything, but I feel like we shouldn’t talk about a specific number (unless it’s 400+ and therefore “High”) being crazy high because it can make people feel they aren’t managing their diabetes right when for a lot of people they are making strides in the right direction and being in the low 200s is going to be a part of that journey down.

Got my first sub 7 A1C Ever, in 20 years, last month, so I’ve been on both sides of feeling like 200s is pretty high. There have been months I would start to notice I was high at 220, 230, 240 and I remember 1 day after 2 weeks of almost perfect management (at great personal and social expense) and when I went to 180 I thought I was going to be sick 🤢 anyway, it’s all been part of a journey to where I am now, which is like “the goal” so yeah, I know it wasn’t intended negatively in any way, I just know if I wasn’t where I am right now that would have been hard for me to read - basically giving me another reason to justify negative self talk about my diabetes treatment abilities.

I bought 50 strips for $9.99. It has 90 days of expiration date, so it's a lot more than I can actually use. Also low carb doesn't have to be expensive. You don't have to buy fancy steaks etc. You can eat chicken, which isn't expensive. You can get beef chuck roast, which is about 5 bucks per pound I believe. Ya, the only downside is you'll have to learn to make your own meals. But it doesn't mean you have to cook every day. When I feel lazy, I just eat the sausages or precooked chicken strips from Costco."

I didn’t know what to do and I had the added stress of being told I could no longer try for kids till I got my sugar under control. Needless to say the diagnosis was devastating and the follow up medical appointments I found mostly useless. I even got set up with a diabetic clinic, but by the time they got me in I already reworked my whole lifestyle and they started with “diabetes is ur body not using insulin right, or being unable to make it- do you know what ur pancreases is? “ I nearly laughed at him. 

This is a hard journey and will impact the rest of ur life, but it’s not the end of it, it’s just the start of a new way of thinking etc.

Edit: I found it! It looks like what happened was my blood sugar dropped into the 80s so my pod stopped giving me insulin (my range is 100-120) and it went 85 minutes without giving any. It didn't give me any until my blood sugar went over 120 and at that point it started giving me 0.1-0.15 units every 5 minutes but I think my BG was rising too quickly at that point and it shot up to around 220"

Sadly I know how you feel, I got diagnosed at 17. 

Just to be triple sure, did your doctor run antibody tests or a c-peptide? The only reason I ask is because that’s how they rule out type 1. 

You’ll get used to the needles in no time, I used to have a fear of them pretty badly, but over time it’s just become a routine every day thing. Just keep with it!

Super glad that you haven’t had any GI problems with Metformin. Constipation isn’t typically an issue on Metformin, rather the other way around. 

Just be committed to it, watch your carb intake, take your meds, and try not to let the anxiety of it all get to you too much.

Feel free to ask any questions you have, some of us are veterans at this point."

UpToDate (dosing and healthcare info doctors use) recommends basal insulin when a1c is >=9%. Current research shows initial insulin therapy to force normoglycemia results in better long term outcomes.

Unfortunately one of the parts of being diabetic is advocating for yourself. I would push for antibody tests for type 1, just to make sure. A C-peptide will tell you how much insulin your pancreas is producing. 

A lot of times type 1 or type 1.5 (LADA) are misdiagnosed as Type 2, and unfortunately the consequences can be dangerous."

Healthcare people are still people; many are wonderful human beings, but were C students at best.

Ask to be referred to an endocrinologist and a diabetic nutritionist asap. Have them test you for type 1. If they fight you on getting referred to a proper care team because their little egos get bruised, find a new doctor. Or nurse. Or whoever. A disgusting amount of them don't know squat about diabetes and give horrible advice. You'll want to see people who made it their specialty for your care.
And even then you'll need to self advocate often. They'll just leave you sitting, you'll have to actively direct your care. Again, they're all just people, some are better at their jobs than others. Shop around until you find a good team. Don't be scared to speak up for yourself.

It seems overwhelming and terrifying at first, but you'll adapt quickly, and it all becomes routine.

Read up on the advice given here, but don't take random redditor advice as gospel either. Lots of pseudo-intellectuals on here who like to give harmful advice just to feel valid. Do a lot of research online, get familiar with the types and their symptoms and treatments. Don't fall for fad diets and weird advice. Do not change or stop any meds without discussing it with your healthcare team, no matter what people on here might advise (especially the homeopathy advocating assholes)

I'm pretty new to this as well because I've only found out I have prediabetes 2 months ago. But I've done a fair bit of research. Basically you have to pay attention to what's called ""net carb"". It is the total carbohydrates minus the amount of fiber. Fiber is included in the carb section of food label, but since our body can't digest fiber, you can count that out. I suggest you keep your net carb to under 50 net grams per day. If you don't see improvements in a few weeks, you can continue cutting down the amount of carbs. If you do see improvements, you can either keep 50 net carbs, or you can increase that amount and see how your body reacts. The point is experiment because everyone's body is different. Also, avoid keto breads and tortillas etc., Because they contain something called modified wheat starch. They do cause high blood sugar levels for a lot of people, so just avoid that. If you're a meat lover, a low carb diet will be easy for you. You can eat as much meat as you want. Meat, fish, seafood, etc, are really good and almost no carb. Also eat a good amount of healthy fat, such as animal fat, olive oil, avocado oil, fish oil. Eat lots of green leaf veggies. Avoid starchy veggies such as potatoes etc. Don't eat too much fruit because they have a lot of sugar. If you want to eat fruits, look up the amount of net carbs they have and see if they fit into your daily net carb goal. Avoid milk because milk has a lot of carbs. I think this is the basics. Feel free to let me know if you have any specific questions."

Increased anxiety from Metformin?,"Hey, y'all.   


I have seen some older threads on this subject but thought I'd start a new one to see if more folks have had similar experiences. About three to four weeks after starting Metformin (500mg daily), I began experiencing extreme anxiety and an almost complete loss of appetite. Food has become so unappealing to me that even the mere suggestion of it makes me feel nauseated. It takes me hours to finish a small meal.   


The anxiety has been the worst part, tho. I finally reached a breaking point today and took myself over to the ER. The ER doc's advice: stop taking metformin immediately. Anxiety is apparently one of the ""less common"" side effects, but the more common GI side effects are similar to the somatic symptoms of anxiety.   


I have been medicated for depression and anxiety for years but had been doing well with both until recently. While I have been experiencing increased stress over the last few weeks from work and elsewhere, my anxiety level just doesn't seem appropriate.  I can't concentrate. I wake up earlier and earlier with more and more anxiety. I feel like I'm barely hanging on.  


If you've experienced anything similar, I would love to hear from you. Today is my first day off metformin. I wish I could say I am hopeful things will improve, but the cloud I've been under is heavy and wide (like me). Any encouragement would be greatly appreciated.

The anxiety has been the worst part, tho. I finally reached a breaking point today and took myself over to the ER. The ER doc's advice: stop taking metformin immediately. Anxiety is apparently one of the ""less common"" side effects, but the more common GI side effects are similar to the somatic symptoms of anxiety.   


I have been medicated for depression and anxiety for years but had been doing well with both until recently. While I have been experiencing increased stress over the last few weeks from work and elsewhere, my anxiety level just doesn't seem appropriate.  I can't concentrate. I wake up earlier and earlier with more and more anxiety. I feel like I'm barely hanging on.  


If you've experienced anything similar, I would love to hear from you. Today is my first day off metformin. I wish I could say I am hopeful things will improve, but the cloud I've been under is heavy and wide (like me). Any encouragement would be greatly appreciated.

Side effects are a thing though. Honestly I’d say try it for a bit longer and see if some weight loss and sugar dropping improves your mood.

Our plans are identical and we made sure to compare before I signed up for own. I got a call from my hospitals pharmacy telling me my new pricing would be $300 for a 3 month supply of sensors and $120 for a transmitter. I’m just wondering if that is close to what others are paying or does this seem crazy high? The pharmacist told me that if I switched to a doctor within my hospitals system it would take $60 off my copays but that’s not even that big of difference and I would prefer to stay with my current Endo. If you all don’t mind sharing what you pay for Dexcom with your insurance so that I can figure out if maybe something is wrong or if this is just normal pricing and I was just getting a good deal at the pharmacy I used to use?

Yes, 500 is a terrible number too be at, and it is hurting his body. If it stays that way it sets him up for HHS: severe dehydration. 

He needs to drink water to flush it out and to take his medication as needed. But we don’t know his needs or his brands of medication.

A one-time.food is “forgiveable” but it should not stay at 500. If you have trouble getting it down or don’t know how, then you need to consult a physician or nurse.

For me I'm taking metformin which helps dial down that process (gluconeogenesis), and also run my tandem pump in sleep mode which adjusts my basal before it gets to a level I should correct for.

The G3 sensors can definitely work and be accurate. They just take more effort than Dexcom. The new 780G Medtronic pump is due out very soon now in the U.S. and is already available in a lot of the world.

For various reasons relating to my travels, I have stayed with Medtronic. Their pumps are just better for me even with relatively inferior sensors.

I wrote a document of tips for sensor accuracy with the Guardian 3 sensors that may help if you've been having trouble with them. It's not an official document from Medtronic, just my notes. So, feel free to ask me any questions.

For background, I've been using Medtronic sensors since the harpoon gun and terribly named SofSensors in 2007. So, the G3's are awesome by comparison. But, both the Dexcom and the G4 should be a lot better.

Still, I do get accurate results from the G3."

Yes. You can place an order for the upgrade kit to the 780G. Medtronic are being annoying as hell about not saying exactly when it will be shipped.

It is a software upgrade. But, apparently they need to ship a kit for the upgrade. I expect that this will include a G4 transmitter and instructions for exactly how to do a software update.

I got on the list within a few minutes of them opening the site to take orders. I still haven't gotten mine.

When I tried to ask for details on when it might come so that I'd know whether to buy another box of G3 sensors, the best they could tell me is that I will be able to trade in sealed boxes of the G3 sensors for G4 sensors. So, I bought another box a week or so ago.

I hate how they refuse to give out information even on the delivery of a pump that is at least 38 months behind schedule in the U.S. It's infuriating. But, I really do prefer the pump itself to Tandem. And, I think the new auto mode algorithm may be really good.

Is there a way to reconnect tubing that is leaking from my tandem x2 trusteel insert site,"I've been getting an annoying amount of leaks from my trusteel recently. Not like I was with autosoft, but still more than I'd like.

So I'm thinking the tubing has to be leaking, is there anyway to check/fix if it's loose while it's still inserted in me?

Sorry if this is a stupid question, but I'm curious",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14tqb1q/is_there_a_way_to_reconnect_tubing_that_is/,"I wouldn't be injecting insulin like that, that's usually insulin that was injected in you but finds/works it's way back out on the outside of the cannula, or tunnelling.

If you're concerned about running low on pump sites you could pull the needle out and stab it back in to another cleaned area hoping that a better seal around the cannula/needle forms, but it has higher risk of infection.

It's better to change the site when you notice a problem and eliminate the risk of dka, also let your Dr know about your sites failing early and they can change your script to 2 days instead of 3(if not already done)

To try to prevent it you can try tape over the plastic top part of the site to keep it from catching on clothing and trying to widen the hole around the cannula when it moves around.

You can also try changing to a deeper cannula/needle(if available)"
Problems with my girlfriends diabetes,"Hey guys, so this might be long so I apologize in advance, i’m just looking for some advice. To put it as short as possible, my girlfriend has had diabetes since 9, and i’ve took her to the er for low numbers, DKA scares, and so much more mostly pertaining to diabetes. i’ve had to call 911 for her 3 times to get an IV with glucose because her number gets insanely low and extreme delirium. Her main problem is night time after she’s fell asleep.

So down to why I made the post. More often than not her number goes either super high (300+) or super low (45-) while she’s asleep.

When I wake her up, she starts calling me names like “piece of sh*t” and “stupid bi*ch” along with moans and just overall bad attitude because I woke her up out of her sleep. She’s a super sweet girl and when her number is good she wouldn’t ever say stuff like that to me so I don’t hold it against her but it’s just so hard to deal with the way she acts sometimes. She doesn’t seem to care as much as I do about her health and values sleep over her health. I force her to drink the orange juice which is always a struggle that takes atleast 20 minutes.

I just wanna know what we can do to better avoid situations like these.

 Might be worth having that as then it's not you waking her up, but her alarm (I know for my libre they keep going until the bg gets back in range) and having glucose tablets/juice by the bed so she doesn't have to get up, so she can take care of her hypos herself, removing you from the equation?

Additionally, being really low can alter your mental state, I know I can get more emotional or spaced out, but being called those sorts of words is not fair or kind.  I know she said ""you'll never understand what it's like to have diabetes"" which is true, but its not an excuse.

Could she be having some burnout and that's why her numbers are more varied?"

My blood glucose dropped in the middle of the night (pre CGM) to 28. My partner at the time called the paramedics apparently I was fighting him and wouldn’t let him give me my glucagon. The paramedics and fire department arrived. I was told by the paramedics it took 3 firefighters to hold me down to get an IV in me to bring my blood glucose up. I have no recollection of any of this what’s so ever. I was told later by my endo when your blood glucose drops so low it’s equivalent to someone having stroke. It can really mess with the brain. While I’m not condoning her behavior because with a CGM you can set alarms that prevent you from going so low or so high, I do recommend you both sit down with her Endocrinologist (if she has one) or a diabetic educator to understand more of what’s going on and ways to prevent it. That’s what my husband did in the beginning of our relationship and it made a big difference.

Also…is a pump an option for her? The best sleep I’ve had since my kid was diagnosed has been since the pump. She’s using the t-slim with Control IQ, and paired with the dexcom, it does a lot to keep her in range without either of us having to think about it. 

I really commend you for taking such an active role in her diabetes. I can only hope that my kid’s future partners will be so helpful and engaged. It affects the whole family - you kind of have to be, really, but many aren’t. ❤️"

I’m hearing comments as if this behavior is a choice and it’s not.   OP, only you can choose to stay in this relationship.  It takes a special person to support a chronically ill person and not everyone has the stamina for it.  There is no reason to feel guilty if you aren’t up to the challenge, especially at 19.  If you want to ride it out, I suggest therapy from someone experienced in chronic illness.  You aren’t going to find answers here.  It takes professional help to navigate this type of problem long term.  What I feel should be the focus is the poor healthcare your girlfriend is getting, assuming she is doing what she is told to do as far as her care regimen.  It is well documented that glucose variability causes mental deficits and personality changes.  Everyone’s focus should be on why your gf’s glucose is so out of wack, especially at night.   I once counseled a woman who was on 70 extra units of long acting insulin and who had gained 50 pounds.  Basically, her doctor was an idiot.  If your gf is on long acting insulin, she may be on the wrong kind or be taking too much.  She may be over treating her highs or under bolusing for fatty meals.  Her monthly cycle can be causing issues and even sex can make us crash an hour or so later.   There are many reasons why your gfs glucose is so variable but the point is, all of them are controllable if you find a better care team and do the work to figure out how to remedy the situation.  She may need to go on birth control, or break up her long acting dosage, or change her long acting insulin.  Of course, a pump with control IQ is ideal.  If you focus on fixing the reason she is being verbally abusive at night, then she will be in better health and it will no longer be an issue.  When we are in it, it’s almost impossible to see how to get out of it.  That I can say with certainty.  I have a written list of actions to take when my glucose seems off because troubleshooting is not very easy when your head has been in a blender for awhile.  Of course, the bottom line is does she want her glucose to be better? If the answer is yes, get her the help she needs to troubleshoot this problem.  I’m the answer is no, then therapy to help navigate why not and to support you."

She’s made it your responsibility and behaves poorly when you try to help.  It needs to stop.  She needs to manage her care better.  Whether it’s different tech or doing better math or just plain giving a shit.  I don’t like getting woken up to eat candy.  My wife hates waking me up because I sleep like shit as it is.  I’ve never snapped at her.  Granted I’m rarely under 60 when it happens but there’s a reason for that.  I told her to wake me up if I go under 70.  We’ve discussed this hen to wake me up.  You have Dexcom.  Set the night alarms higher.  Get sugar in her earlier.  The low crankiness is likely much less at 70 instead of 50.  If she’s still cussing you out at 70 it ain’t the diabetes.  You’re both adults.  She needs to start acting like one.  You aren’t her mom.

To put it as short as possible, my girlfriend has had diabetes since 9, and i’ve took her to the er for low numbers, DKA scares, and so much more mostly pertaining to diabetes. i’ve had to call 911 for her 3 times to get an IV with glucose because her number gets insanely low and extreme delirium. Her main problem is night time after she’s fell asleep. She recently got Dexcom and it’s been 10x better than before which i’m so thankful for and she seems to be happy with it. i’ve learned everything i know about diabetes from her and her mom, she’s the first person i’ve lived with that had diabetes. we’re both 19 if that means anything.

So down to why I made the post. More often than not her number goes either super high (300+) or super low (45-) while she’s asleep. When i’m home, I stay up usually all night due to my schedule for work being 7pm-5:30am and I watch her number on the app. When it gets low, I grab her some orange juice and a glucose tablet and try to wake her up. When I wake her up, she starts calling me names like “piece of sh*t” and “stupid bi*ch” along with moans and just overall bad attitude because I woke her up out of her sleep. She’s a super sweet girl and when her number is good she wouldn’t ever say stuff like that to me so I don’t hold it against her but it’s just so hard to deal with the way she acts sometimes. She doesn’t seem to care as much as I do about her health and values sleep over her health. I force her to drink the orange juice which is always a struggle that takes atleast 20 minutes. She says things like “well if you had diabetes you’d understand” and things like that and I feel like for the most part I have a pretty good understanding, or I try to atleast. I just wanna know what we can do to better avoid situations like these.

She needs a pump if possible.  If not, she needs to adjust her long acting insulin.  I would take mine in two doses, in the morning and in the evening to make sure I was covered overnight.

Also, because she doesn't seem to wake up from notifications from her phone when her Dexcom hits highs and lows, I recommend a Fitbit or Apple Watch that can connect to Dexcom.  I have a Fitbit with a clock face that feeds me my BS and if it hits the thresholds I've established, it vibrates and wakes me up.  A lot harder to sleep through that."

Low blood sugars are not an excuse to be verbally abusive to your partner or anyone else and it's annoying that you and other people on this thread are making excuses for your girlfriend. I admit that I feel like crap and get angrier more easily when my blood sugars are off (for me it's when they're high, not when they're low) but I don't take it out on people around me. You shouldn't put up with that.

Also, managing your girlfriend's diabetes is her responsibility, not yours. She has a Dexcom? A continuous glucose monitoring system? Then you shouldn't have to also monitor her blood sugars. The system should have some alarms for when her blood sugar gets out of whack."

I was diagnosed when I was 2. But I just want to start off by saying I think you are doing a great job. More than what most men these days would do. In my experience anyways. Low blood sugar is a scary one. I’ve had some scary lows myself. And I’ve been in the place where my mom was trying to give me juice and I did nothing but call her names and degrade her. When I came back to consciousness I didn’t know or remember I had said that. My mom is quite familiar with my diabetes but she was teary explaining what had just happened to me. I felt terrible and cried. She may just be experiencing a bit of a diabetes burnout. It gets to be a lot managing it on top of daily tasks. Especially when managing it becomes more challenging than not most days.  It’s a full time job on top already a full time job\school or whatever. I would maybe just ask her if there’s anything that you can do to help make it easier for her? Also maybe leave her little notes? “Don’t forget a bed time snack” “did you bolus?” I think you are doing a fantastic job and I hope she is thankful for all that you are doing and trying to learn.

T1D parent here. I first off want to say, you’re doing great. It sounds like the abuse you are experiencing is all the fault of the disease. When you are low, you are not yourself. 

There are other way diabetes effects our mental health as well. The tedium of having to dose for everything… the feeling of being a pin cushion. If you are already depressed, managing diabetes can make it worse. 

With my kid, I have become the face of the care regimen. How much anger they have towards having to do the things is aimed at me, and that is not okay. Thing is, as a caretaker you have to determine what is okay and what isn’t. 

Just reading your story here, it sounds like you have experienced what it’s like dealing with a low person. Even still, if both of you have access to therapy, use that access. Sometimes we need someone to talk to, and the internet is not always the best place to do that. 

However, it’s sounds like your GF is experiencing lows frequently. This may point to an issue with your treatment regime. If you can, I would have her bring it up with her endocrinologist. Other people have mentioned using the pump, and I will agree, the pump is a medical miracle. It has worked well for us. 

One thing I don’t see mention of is the pump can be prohibitively expensive depending on where you live, and your health coverage. We live in the US, and with our health coverage, the co-pay for the pump is $4k (that we pay in installments) with a $400ish re-supply every 6ish months. It sucks, but it’s worth it for us. 

There’s a lot of nuance to dealing with this issue. Nobody here is going to have the absolute correct answer. I’ve seen some people in this thread lash out like my kid lashes out at me when I’ve tried to remind them to check their blood sugar. 

Get some therapy if you can and see if you can figure out why she is going low so regularly."

Honestly, I’ve just learned to ignore it or laugh about it. On some level she’s right that you don’t or can’t understand if you don’t have diabetes. Being woken up in the middle of the night is already unpleasant, let alone waking up into an altered mental state.

If I had to guess, she’s probably a little burned out and longing to feel ‘normal’. That can make you resent anyone that reminds you of what you’re trying to ignore, even if temporarily."

She needs to do what she needs to do to better control her diabetes so that this isn't a routine experience. 

The plan shouldn't be for you to try and do your best only to be treated like shit and then later be told well if you had diabetes you'd understand. She's right since this is her diabetes she should deal with getting it under better control so these incidents are rare. Beyond not having to have you deal with them, the roller coaster of highs and lows makes people feel awful & that's not fun.   


A Dexcom and pump that are connected will help. Pump can suspect insulin or give extra to help try and stay in range. Will know to give less based on trends.  


A snack with protein and fat with some carbs before bed can help some people stay stable throughout the night. My kiddo has lows on nights they don't have a bedtime snack. So they have dinner earlier in the day so they're hungry for that snack."
Problems with my girlfriends diabetes,"Hey guys, so this might be long so I apologize in advance, i’m just looking for some advice. To put it as short as possible, my girlfriend has had diabetes since 9, and i’ve took her to the er for low numbers, DKA scares, and so much more mostly pertaining to diabetes. i’ve had to call 911 for her 3 times to get an IV with glucose because her number gets insanely low and extreme delirium. Her main problem is night time after she’s fell asleep. She recently got Dexcom and it’s been 10x better than before which i’m so thankful for and she seems to be happy with it. i’ve learned everything i know about diabetes from her and her mom, she’s the first person i’ve lived with that had diabetes. we’re both 19 if that means anything.

So down to why I made the post. More often than not her number goes either super high (300+) or super low (45-) while she’s asleep. When i’m home, I stay up usually all night due to my schedule for work being 7pm-5:30am and I watch her number on the app. When it gets low, I grab her some orange juice and a glucose tablet and try to wake her up. When I wake her up, she starts calling me names like “piece of sh*t” and “stupid bi*ch” along with moans and just overall bad attitude because I woke her up out of her sleep. She’s a super sweet girl and when her number is good she wouldn’t ever say stuff like that to me so I don’t hold it against her but it’s just so hard to deal with the way she acts sometimes. She doesn’t seem to care as much as I do about her health and values sleep over her health. I force her to drink the orange juice which is always a struggle that takes atleast 20 minutes. She says things like “well if you had diabetes you’d understand” and things like that and I feel like for the most part I have a pretty good understanding, or I try to atleast. I just wanna know what we can do to better avoid situations like these.

I am recently diagnosed and am so fortunate that I started out with so many options. Folks who have had diabetes a long time before some of this new tech (my 72 year old father) sometimes refuse to change how they manage it due to fear of the “machines” failing them. Myself and my husband get to sleep through the night most of the time worry free. As other have said the pump and CGM have alarms set to warn you way before getting into a dangerous range. I highly recommend Omnipod and Dexcom. Good luck and I hope things work out for you both.

You learn it takes a specific personality and grit to want to do what's best for your body. Some people aren't as interested in managing their diabetes care, others find it super fascinating. Diabetes is a very difficult illness, even when I am at my best days I find it sometimes all too much to bear. It sounds like your girlfriend isn't capable of taking care of herself in the way she needs and needs time to become more mature and decide what she wants to do. Diabetes care is very expensive so I can understand her not being able to afford a pump, and having a CGM is a massive tool that can be helpful. But this story is about you too, and you deserve a partner who treats you right. Even when I am at my lowest and highest blood sugars, I have never called my significant other nasty names like that. Sure, you don't feel good because your blood sugars are off but you don't suddenly lose your ability to control your actions. It sounds like a massive red flag and I would consider going separate ways immediately. 

I am going to be 20 and I go to the endocrinologist every 3 months for diabetes management, tweaking my care and ensuring I can sleep through the night without spiking or dropping. It seems really unusual to me that it is a common occurrence for her sugars to be so haywire, and there's obviously an issue there that needs to be tackled. Everyone needs some good undisturbed sleep! Which includes an obviously very caring partner who seems exhausted that their efforts seem unappreciated and disrespected."

It’s not ever our partners fault (or in your situation, your fault) we get so overwhelmed with having it, and feeling like we got it down pat, and then it sky rockets or plummets super low and we just kinda have small moments or times where we mentally give up. It’s a pain in the ass. You’re awesome for learning about it and trying to help any way you can. The BEST advice i would recommend is this: MEAL PREP. Constantly and every chance you can. Not only will this benefit ANYONE, but it’s absolutely NEEDED for diabetics. If she doesn’t have any type of pump or modern therapy, meal prepping has to be it. Meat and veggies. You can even do those meal kits online, they tell you how many grams of carbs are in each meal, you can help her by getting those ready, Getting shots ready for her (if she uses the InPen or regular insulin pens) get a shot ready 15-30 minutes in advance. (This is only if y’all have a solid, set routine where if you wake up before she does, and you know y’all usually eat say at around 9am, and y’all wake up at 8am…at 830, give her the shot for the prepped meal, and then at 9, microwave it or cook it, depending on the prep time and what not) get on her ass about shit foods, like Starbucks and McDonald’s and things like that. Also, if she’s just “swingin’ it” as in, “oh i know what I’m doing! I’ll just take insulin later” refuse to go get food with her or take her (if her sugars are already high). A bad habit that i had (I’m sure a lot of diabetics have, too) is when we drop low, we don’t eat or drink something in regards to how many grams of carbs it has, our main thought is to get our sugar back up because it’s scary af but we also feel like shit when it drops low. So get her to experiment with it. She’ll have to fast for like a day or 2 (2 just to be on the safe side) have her numbers get in range. Take 1 unit of insulin, see how much that drops it. Do this for several factors (with sleep, without sleep, with simple carbs (junk food/cereal/white bread/pizza dough/pasta), with complex carbs (potatoes, whole wheat bread, beans, fruits, vegetables)…simple carbs will make sugars rise continuously over a certain time frame, while most complex carbs will actually go down and stay down with insulin shots/deliveries. There’s so much that goes into, you have to experiment with it (not you, but she does) that way she can know her insulin resistance factor, her regular insulin to carb ratio, all of it. There’s also an app i use, not sure if a lot of people know about it, but it’s called “Calorie King” and it tells you how many calories/carbs/fat whatever! Is in any food. It’s like nutrition label google for foods! 😂 all kinds of things will affect the insulin resistance, i stress WAY TOO MUCH, more than i should, and stress can affect my insulin resistance, normally a soda is around 44g of carbs and like 1.5 or 2 units will attack that properly, but on days when I’m extremely stressed, and i drink a soda, it’ll usually be like 5 or 6 units to “attack” the soda and drop my numbers back down in range. Not only should she be this knowledgeable about these things in general because she’ll be living with this for the rest of her life, but endocrinologists are pains in the ass when trying to get an insulin pump, they will tell her to do these same things to make sure she KNOWS how to take care of herself if the pump were to ever fail or malfunction. All in all, keep doing what you’re doing! You’re a great partner whether she sees it or not. And if its relationship problems too, the one and only thing i can chip in is COMMUNICATE, respectfully and effectively. Sit down with her and express to her all of these things, ask her if she’s down to try them, how much you care, how much she needs to care, if she retaliates by trying to make you out to be the problem or the bad guy, or starts a fight, or gives any type of toxic yelling or attitude, she needs to mature. Anyways, meal prep, experiment, calorie king, communicate, mature. 😂😂😂 hope this has helped in any way! 🙏🏻❤️"

But I can tell you of a story of me getting low on a church trip. Didn't eat a 8pm snack cause organization and church. The next morning I woke up to the youth leader with my mom on the house phone yelling at me to eat. The nurse that traveled with us was feeding me peanut butter crackers and calming me down. I didn't know what happened at all. My younger sister said I was low and wasn't responding and when the nurse tried to feed me I told her to go suck on Satan's nuts. And called the youth leader Satan spawn and to leave me the f alone I trying to bang chick's and leave me in bed. I called the nurse many of names. I was 13 at the time. Spent the next three days trying to apologize to the nurse as we went and ate pb and jelly sandwiches at 8 pm for the rest of the trip. It happens and sadly as a non diabetic you never experience cussing out the one that is saving your life and not remembering it. I have just as many black out memories as a drunk, and I wish I could remember just half of the hurtful things I let slip out of my mouth."
Problems with my girlfriends diabetes,"Hey guys, so this might be long so I apologize in advance, i’m just looking for some advice. To put it as short as possible, my girlfriend has had diabetes since 9, and i’ve took her to the er for low numbers, DKA scares, and so much more mostly pertaining to diabetes. i’ve had to call 911 for her 3 times to get an IV with glucose because her number gets insanely low and extreme delirium. Her main problem is night time after she’s fell asleep. She recently got Dexcom and it’s been 10x better than before which i’m so thankful for and she seems to be happy with it. i’ve learned everything i know about diabetes from her and her mom, she’s the first person i’ve lived with that had diabetes. we’re both 19 if that means anything.

So down to why I made the post. More often than not her number goes either super high (300+) or super low (45-) while she’s asleep. When i’m home, I stay up usually all night due to my schedule for work being 7pm-5:30am and I watch her number on the app. When it gets low, I grab her some orange juice and a glucose tablet and try to wake her up. When I wake her up, she starts calling me names like “piece of sh*t” and “stupid bi*ch” along with moans and just overall bad attitude because I woke her up out of her sleep. She’s a super sweet girl and when her number is good she wouldn’t ever say stuff like that to me so I don’t hold it against her but it’s just so hard to deal with the way she acts sometimes. She doesn’t seem to care as much as I do about her health and values sleep over her health. I force her to drink the orange juice which is always a struggle that takes atleast 20 minutes.

For her, hook hers up to her phone with an alert and have it by her bed. I do this and can still sleep through it. Maybe get a Bluetooth boom box to sync it to. 

Diabetics are tired. We've fought this shit every moment and I'm sure many of us want to give up. People don't like being woken up. You've both got valid complaints here and if you talk about it when she's not half asleep I think the conversation will go better."

I also have sometimes where people bring me juice because I’m low and dizzy but had I been alone I could’ve gotten it myself. 

Like when someone has a chronic illness it should be expected the partner has to help out occasionally but at no point should taking care of the person become their full responsibility because that’s not fair"

Don't offer advice you haven't earned the right to give.  It's not denial in the least that causes this, but physiology.  She (they) can't help it.  

Until you can understand that, stop hurting her by blaming her. Bailing on her is the exact WRONG thing to do.   She can't do this on her own, no matter how much she wants to.   I get It's difficult to understand she needs to be taken care of when she can't do it for herself. These issues are intrinsic to the disease and unavoidable.  

No matter how much all of you want to blame her for this... and I think all of you are sadistic for doing that....ultimately you're saying she's not worth the burden she is to you. And props to OP for being able to communicate the issue to this degree.  The struggle is real.  You just have to understand that that is the disease talking, not her self.

If you'd like to be helpful, which, OP seems to, burnout is real.  Support is vital."

Tbh, dexcom alarms are a lot louder and freak me out. There's no way the gf doesnt hear them, they wake up everyone in my house and I live in a 3000 SQ ft home. I agree with your point on blood sugar burnout. It takes a toll when it feels like you can never relax which may explain why the gf doesn't want to treat her sugars. When your management is in the level of personalization you need, diabetes is still a chore but you always have a method to fall back on that requires less thought or distress.

If the boyfriend already has her Dexcom information and is helping her, I'd set the threshold to be lower/higher than maybe it is already is to stop the more severe reactions she's having.  Also you can have it trigger rapid rise and fall, which might not be a bad idea for them.  

Like, I really love my sleep, but if I see my BS hit 80, I know waking up for 30 seconds to eat a couple gummies from a resealable bag next to my bed will do the trick and get me back much faster than if my BS hits below 70."
Problems with my girlfriends diabetes,"Hey guys, so this might be long so I apologize in advance, i’m just looking for some advice. To put it as short as possible, my girlfriend has had diabetes since 9, and i’ve took her to the er for low numbers, DKA scares, and so much more mostly pertaining to diabetes. i’ve had to call 911 for her 3 times to get an IV with glucose because her number gets insanely low and extreme delirium. Her main problem is night time after she’s fell asleep. She recently got Dexcom and it’s been 10x better than before which i’m so thankful for and she seems to be happy with it. i’ve learned everything i know about diabetes from her and her mom, she’s the first person i’ve lived with that had diabetes. we’re both 19 if that means anything.

So down to why I made the post. More often than not her number goes either super high (300+) or super low (45-) while she’s asleep. When i’m home, I stay up usually all night due to my schedule for work being 7pm-5:30am and I watch her number on the app. When it gets low, I grab her some orange juice and a glucose tablet and try to wake her up. When I wake her up, she starts calling me names like “piece of sh*t” and “stupid bi*ch” along with moans and just overall bad attitude because I woke her up out of her sleep. She’s a super sweet girl and when her number is good she wouldn’t ever say stuff like that to me so I don’t hold it against her but it’s just so hard to deal with the way she acts sometimes.

I agree her control isn't great but she also is still pretty young. As to op, you sound like a great guy and care a lot. For her this is a lifetime struggle, for you it is a lifetime choice. I'm not sure where you live but a pump may be a great solution for her if available and financially doable. Some changes in her insulin intake and the kinds  she is taking may help too but that's her care teams job to figure out.  She is right, you aren't diabetic, you will never fully understand, but you can answer to that:"".. but I try, and I try to keep you alive so we have a future because I care"".  And you do.

Good to hear.  I’m glad I’m not the only one but that is how my brain feels.   I don’t think people pay enough attention to the glucose needs of the brain and the implications because the brain controls literally everything else.
Problems with my girlfriends diabetes,"Hey guys, so this might be long so I apologize in advance, i’m just looking for some advice. To put it as short as possible, my girlfriend has had diabetes since 9, and i’ve took her to the er for low numbers, DKA scares, and so much more mostly pertaining to diabetes. i’ve had to call 911 for her 3 times to get an IV with glucose because her number gets insanely low and extreme delirium. Her main problem is night time after she’s fell asleep. She recently got Dexcom and it’s been 10x better than before which i’m so thankful for and she seems to be happy with it. i’ve learned everything i know about diabetes from her and her mom, she’s the first person i’ve lived with that had diabetes. we’re both 19 if that means anything.

So down to why I made the post. More often than not her number goes either super high (300+) or super low (45-) while she’s asleep. When i’m home, I stay up usually all night due to my schedule for work being 7pm-5:30am and I watch her number on the app. When it gets low, I grab her some orange juice and a glucose tablet and try to wake her up. When I wake her up, she starts calling me names like “piece of sh*t” and “stupid bi*ch” along with moans and just overall bad attitude because I woke her up out of her sleep. She’s a super sweet girl and when her number is good she wouldn’t ever say stuff like that to me so I don’t hold it against her but it’s just so hard to deal with the way she acts sometimes. She doesn’t seem to care as much as I do about her health and values sleep over her health. I force her to drink the orange juice which is always a struggle that takes atleast 20 minutes. She says things like “well if you had diabetes you’d understand” and things like that and I feel like for the most part I have a pretty good understanding, or I try to atleast.

It’s not an obligation to help someone who is repeatedly verbally abusive, however. I can’t take care of someone if I don’t take care of my mental health first. I share my responsibilities with my mother for this reason; everyone (including my T1 sister) is in mutual agreement on this. It may be out of your control during the hypoglycaemic episode, though it is still necessary (and healthy) to apologise when you’re back in range and feeling better. I’ve explained this to my sister; diabetes or not, you’re accountable for the affect of your behaviour on those around you. I love her very much and will always be there with a juice box and some cookies, though I am still human and words are hurtful - even if there’s no malice behind them."

When he had to help I never got angry with him(As far as I'm aware) a little irritable on occasion sure, but never cursing at him or refusing to eat or drink. She's 19. She's probably resentful of having diabetes and just trying to pretend she doesn't have it and doing the bare minimum to stay alive. I've been there! I landed myself in the hospital with DKA and I started trying to take care of myself. Hopefully she'll learn to do the same, but it's not OP's responsibility to teach her."

Language is important. Loving, supporting, uplifting, etc.  But counseling or group support may be a better constructive suggestion instead of simply focusing on the negatives of it.  Odds are good that putting boundaries on her that she has no control over is a harmful thing to her and counter productive. Not everyone can get it and not everyone is working for her best interest (i.e. love? Support? Help?) Why is it such a burden to help watch sugar levels and offer some snacks when appropriate?  Why focus on yourself as the victim instead of responding to a need for help?"

It's not just ""help watch sugar levels and offer some snacks."" What OP is describing and what the commenter said about their father is taking full responsibility for someone who can't or won't take care of their own diabetes.

Our loved ones take on a little extra worry because they are with someone who has a lifelong, life-threatening condition. But we are not entitled to throw all the burden for our care onto another person, unless we become incapacitated. What would she do if she didn't have someone watching her all night, fighting her to keep her alive? She'd probably have to figure out a better way to care for herself, right? Talk to her doctor, do some research, ask her mom?

I get that we often need help, but that doesn't translate into ""deserve to take over someone else's life to get help."""

My sister voluntarily approaches me and apologises if she sees fit. I’ll never force her to do that - it’s entirely voluntary and always appreciated. That’s called maturity and accountability.

Is it OK to continue to bail on her then, too? She needs support that is real, not just a fake emotion that passes for caring but is really apathy."
Problems with my girlfriends diabetes,"Hey guys, so this might be long so I apologize in advance, i’m just looking for some advice. To put it as short as possible, my girlfriend has had diabetes since 9, and i’ve took her to the er for low numbers, DKA scares, and so much more mostly pertaining to diabetes. i’ve had to call 911 for her 3 times to get an IV with glucose because her number gets insanely low and extreme delirium. Her main problem is night time after she’s fell asleep. She recently got Dexcom and it’s been 10x better than before which i’m so thankful for and she seems to be happy with it. i’ve learned everything i know about diabetes from her and her mom, she’s the first person i’ve lived with that had diabetes. we’re both 19 if that means anything.

So down to why I made the post. More often than not her number goes either super high (300+) or super low (45-) while she’s asleep. When i’m home, I stay up usually all night due to my schedule for work being 7pm-5:30am and I watch her number on the app. When it gets low, I grab her some orange juice and a glucose tablet and try to wake her up. When I wake her up, she starts calling me names like “piece of sh*t” and “stupid bi*ch” along with moans and just overall bad attitude because I woke her up out of her sleep. She’s a super sweet girl and when her number is good she wouldn’t ever say stuff like that to me so I don’t hold it against her but it’s just so hard to deal with the way she acts sometimes. She doesn’t seem to care as much as I do about her health and values sleep over her health. I force her to drink the orange juice which is always a struggle that takes atleast 20 minutes.

Honest question,"Hey y’all! Not seeking medical advice just opinions, here is a typical day of my glucose control with acarbose 100 mg three times a day. It does tend to go over 200 daily where you see it spike the highest and it goes low every other day where you see the lowest points. I have suffered from reactive hypoglycemia for a decade until recently type 2 diagnosis. Doctor thinks adding metformin will help keep it under better control. Im new to this so does that make sense? Im scared metformin will drop my blood sugar too low but I read it doesn’t make you make more insulin so it sounds like it may be a good idea.

Side effects... constipation (though not always), insomnia, fatigue, nausea. They are the worst the day or two after my dose each week. So nothing unbearable. 

Mounjaro makes me immediately accountable for eating poorly and I appreciate that. It has redefined my relationship with food. If I eat too much or too many carbs I will be miserable for 12ish hours. Just bloating and indigestion things. The life changes I made were critical to the success I've had with the medicine."

Initially I was sticking more to low carb because it helped suppress appetite while waiting to get the dose high enough to help suppress my appetite when I had higher amounts of carbs.  I lost weight faster the less carbs I had, but that was also a large source of calories that I didn't try to replace.  
Now I typically have 0-100g/day of carbs, and some days of mostly fasting with a small snack here or there, and cheat days every now and then.

I intend to get down to around 150-160, but I'm in no real rush and don't want to go too fast if my skin can't keep up, so far I only notice some minor stretch marks, which is fine."

Best insurance-covered meds and supplies to request for T1 & 2 diabetics?,"Apart from the standards like cgm and pump supplies, glucose meter etc., what have you requested from your insurance company to help your diabetes management--asking about medical goods, or meds, specifically for you t1 and t2 preppers out there, what do you stock from insurance requests?

I had success getting a [Gvoke Hypo pen](https://gvokeglucagon.com/)

(disposable glucagon injectors) for the first time. They have a decent shelf life, and they don't need to be refrigerated--you store them at room temp.

I got a standard glucose meter, a one touch that helps calibrate my cgm when necessary.

Antibiotics, got it

Tamiflu, got it

You can’t go back in time and change anything. They can’t go back in time and change anything. Reading through your post shows a lot of blame, anger and finger pointing. So at this point it’s probably best to let that go.

It’s likely type 2, based on what you’ve said. Honestly hard and fast diets with no leeway tend to be less successful, so I wouldn’t look at it as failure if she eats/drinks something she shouldn’t.

Step 2: be supportive. Offer help if she asks for it, but absolutely *do not* inject yourself into her diabetes without being asked for help. This is something a lot of us deal with and it pisses us off to no end when someone tries to police us or our eating.

Complications of poorly controlled diabetes can range from tingly feelings in your fingers/toes, to vision problems, to heart and kidney problems, to amputations, it’s a long list of possible issues. But the good news is that if she gets a handle on things, the probability of encountering those issues drops dramatically."

She can manage her disease on her own and only needs help if she asks someone for it. Also stop blaming her for her diabetes. It seems like you think that her diabetes is her own fault. It isn’t. There’s a lot of shame associated with diabetes because many peoples perception of it is that it’s your own fault. She will get better and get worse but she will need to know that you don’t blame her for this disease and that you support her.

Sure, there’s plenty people can do to take care of their diabetes, but nobody is perfect. If she has Type 2, that is pretty strongly associated with inherited susceptibility. 

Food addiction is part emotional but also part physiological. You see, with the newest class of GLP-1 and GIP receptor agonists, so many people are suddenly losing weight and having near normal glucose, in large part because the medication is mimicking hormonal signals that reduce hunger by way of slowing stomach emptying. So people lose their appetite, and hence eat less and less often. They also help with insulin production and lowering release of glycogen stores. So, see it is not 100% a “fault” of someone in a voluntary manner. 

I mean, even if she did something stupid and caused her diabetes directly — ie. heavy drinking and pancreatitis — what would you be mad about? You’d probably either be upset because you think you care about her more than she cares about herself. But it is her body and her journey. 

Yes. she could use help, but you indicate she has unresolved emotional confusion about food and stress probably. Maybe she needs counseling to deal with her inner issues to address that. 

As far as diabetes goes, there is an A1C of 6.5% or an A1C of 10% or more — and so, the higher the A1C above the low 5%s, the more damage will be occurring from excess glucose and glycation of her tissues. Everyone has glycation but glucose readings above 100 mg/dL for long periods of time are the cause of long term diabetes complications. The higher the numbers and the longer they sit there, the faster a person will suffer nerve damage, CVD, kidney and eye problems and mood issues.

If she finds a proper doctor to prescribe her proper medication, and she can monitor her own glucose levels and make adjustments, if she can understand how her food choices — cognitively and emotionally — then she will be better off. 

But if she doesn’t have access to medication, doesn’t make enough effort to choose better foods and not over eat, doesn’t understand how to manage with exercise and testing — then she has a less rosy prognosis. 

But it is a individualized and physiologically — nobody here can predict your sister’s future. All we can tell you is that the problems of high glucose are reall, are painful and devastating. achoices along the way help a lot, having healthcare and personal support is part of it. Being mad at her isn’t going to help in any way — it’s not supportive. If. you love her, then that’s so nice. If you think you are going to run her life for her, that’s probably a mistake and either “controlling” or “codependent.”’ You can belp her i lots of ways — helping her organize and to have the courage to make her appointment snd go to the doctors as needed. To prepare healthy meals for her when chance comes, and to ask her how she is doing without judgement or shame. 

Type 2, is not a choice but choices can be made to fix her glucose immediately and long term. Type 1 is completely without explanation as to why immune system goes rogue, but again, management is possible. Errors are going to happen.  Food addiction as an attempt at emotional compensation is super common. Hopefully that is her only major vice, and she can find the support and education (Diabetes Educator, books, Youtube, podcasts, support groups) to make better decisions and medication fulfillment. 

Why are you here and she isn’t? You can point her to any of the support groups here or FB or in person, but it is her decision to participate. Don’t hate on her because she is sick and imperfect. It’s understandable to feel like some people don’t take warnings seriously, or don’t make good choices: or perhaps are even doing dumb things and looking for sympathy and for someone else to fix them. At which point does her body’s needs and her health needs spillover into your emotional reaction? You need to separate your understanding of health conditions more from your emotions, just as she needs to separate her intake of food more from her emotional needs.

If you have questions about her diagnosis, what her care regimen is like, what her doctors told her -- all of that is going to come from a kind conversation between you two. There's too many possibilities involved for any of us to offer more specific advice for you or her."

Low battery on Accu-check Guide,"Does anyone have this device? My device started saying low battery within 1-2 months of me using it. I have been using it for around 2 months since then. It just says low battery every time.

Flip the glucometer over and press the button on the right side, toward the center and the back cover will flip off to show the batteries. 

The black button in the middle has a picture of a finger on it. Press down and the batteries pop out.

The usb slot is only for downloading data. It has bluetooth built in so, you don’t even need that to connect it to your phone if you wanted. On iPhone, you can download a program like MySugr that will collect your data, if you can figure it out."

Can you Calibrate a Libre 2?,"Hi everyone,

For the first day or two on a new sensor, each new scan displays a ""check blood"" icon. You're expected to test with fingerstick and enter the results as a note. 

Abbott want you to believe the reader app uses this info to calibrate itself. It might even do that - I certainly would if I were writing the app. But nowhere in the docs does it actually say they use my input. 

The Freestyle 2 design was as current as it could be at the time. Decisions are made in the midst of heavy regulation and a cumbersome approval process.

Can you Calibrate a Libre 2, or do they just suck?",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/14szjeu,"Third party apps (xDrip) let you calibrate Libre sensors.

They try to estimate blood glucose from interstitial fluid. Stick to finger pricks for accuracy and the CGM for trend info. 

I can see it not being accurate enough to monitor early stages of diabetes. This is a fault on your healthcare team though I think. CGMs (imo) are for checking how well insulin boluses have worked, monitoring overnight, and preempting highs and lows with alarms."

Can you Calibrate a Libre 2, or do they just suck?",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/14szjeu,I know ot sounds stupid but prick your finger first them scan libre 10 minutes later. You should find its almost perfectly accurate or at least mine have been. At the same time a finger prick and libre 2 will not be the same because libre 2 measures insterstitial fluid and so this lags behind blood glucose by 5-15 minutes. I always find mines roughly 10 minutes. Just try it and see though as theres no harm in trying. But remember the libre lags behind blood

Can you Calibrate a Libre 2, or do they just suck?",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/14szjeu,"The very existence of that manual check prompt seems to vary a lot, depending on where you are. It sounds like this may have been some FDA approval specific thing. The app doesn't even have that in the EU country where I'm living. I suspect that it's really not doing anything other than the seriously wonky autocalibration where Abbott does include the prompt, either. Guessing you're probably right on that one.

Besides the official app nerfing the full continuous reading function that the sensors are totally set up for, proper calibration is another reason that I regularly use Diabox on the side. I wouldn't use the Abbott app at all if that weren't how data is shared with the endo's office. Running the same sensor on the two different apps, the readings can vary pretty wildly between them--and I trust the ones from Diabox to be much closer to reality, even *before* finger stick calibration. Whatever ""calibration"" algorithm LibreLink is using seems pretty messed up."

Can you Calibrate a Libre 2, or do they just suck?",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/14szjeu,"The time delay with interstitial fluid compared to blood readings can definitely be a factor sometimes. 

But, I also pretty commonly get sensors which the LibreLink autocalibration algorithm reads consistently higher or lower than reality. Even when I'm coasting along pretty steadily, it will read fasting levels a point or two off (or say 20-40 points, in mg/dl). Some sensors go high, others go low--and it is actually pretty reliable as long as I do know what the rough offset from the real reading is this time.

As mentioned in another comment here, I don't think it's the sensors themselves acting screwy, nearly so much as Abbott's substandard official app. Using a third party one that will let me calibrate manually, it's rarely an issue outside of the occasional actually failing sensor. I get the impression that with most of the ""bad"" sensors that people keep getting, it's more a matter of the LibreLink app choking.

(The only real problem there in this case is that the endo's office is getting the funky LibreLink numbers. Hopefully they can figure out what the deal is when the baseline keeps suddenly jumping around between sensors. I will enter some real confirmation readings as notes when it's showing loads of false hypos.)"

I was so frustrated with myself for years. I tried alarms, reminders, putting the supplies out in the open so I could see them at all times, having family help me. Nothing ever worked consistently and I knew I was going to start having serious complications just because I apparently cannot make a habit stick. The beginning of diabetic retinopathy wasn't enough to scare me straight. I was literally going to go blind because I can't make myself do a few injections a day, nevermind pricking my fingers, which almost never happened. I got a CGM and it helped a little. But even when I was on top of my diabetes, then my home and work life started to slip. I could only have my shit together in one area at a time it seemed. The thought of adding healthy habits was a complete nonstarter. I would cry with frustration and rage at myself. 

I got diagnosed with ADHD at 40, and so many things make sense now. My doctor said to try meds (Adderall) and I thought it was overkill, because I'm a relatively successful adult overall, but I gave it a try and I didn't even realize what was happening with my diabetes until my next A1C that was under 8 for the first time in at least 5 years. It's now holding steady at about 6.5. Of course I had noted a few times how I could just think, ""I need to take my shot,"" and then just get up and -do it- instead of realizing an hour later that I hadn't ever moved. Like how I imagine normal people function. But when I really thought about it, I was barely missing a dose anymore, instead of about half of them previously. I walk daily. I don't find myself addicted to junk food. It's like a miracle.

Your body produces cortisol to combat the stress you’re putting on your muscles when lifting, which raises your BG for a short period. When you walk you’re not stressing your muscles, just burning energy so your BG will drop, or stabilize. When you do sprints you’re burning a lot of energy causing your BG to drop. Shortly after you finish sprinting, your body starts producing cortisol causing you to rise, but you can end up crashing hours later if you don’t adjust your basal or boluses."

It’s the only organ that can regenerate its self, but I don’t think taking insulin to combat spikes is going to damage our livers.

My friend’s dad is 74yo and he’s had diabetes since he was 4. In his 60s he had his first amputation and has had several more since then, the most recent one being last year when he had one of his legs below the knee amputated. He also gets dialysis a few times a week. He’s still able to get around his house, take care of himself, and make his meals. He also went on a long road trip recently. He didn’t even get a pump/CGM until about 10 years ago.

He was pretty good about managing his diabetes throughout his life, but was far from perfect. However, even after all he’s been through, he loves his life and is grateful to be alive.

I also recently met a guy playing pickleball who is 64yo and he was diagnosed at 12, just like me. He looked to be in great health, physically and mentally. I told him what my last A1C and his response was, “You’ll be fine!”

Point is, we can live long and healthy lives and shouldn’t worry too much when things don’t go the way we want them. Best we can do is learn and improve.

Besides insulin, movement is the best medicine."

I'm a tall, big guy but I train with a focus on muscle volume and condition over strength.  I used to run 5kms at the start and end of my workout and found I'd always have to drink something to bring my bgs up.  

Now I have a 35 min walk to the gym, then do my anaerobic workout at the gym and a 35 min walk home.  That way my sugar stays pretty much flat the entire workout time because the light cardio is countered by the first half of my weight lifting and the second half of my weight lifting is then countered by the second light cardio.  I've even used weight lifting to prevent an imminent hypo.  I only found out about the impact of anaerobic training recently from a diabetes specialist and it's completely changed the way I work out for the better.

How has neuropathy affected your life?,"Im 33 and have been officially a T1D since 2000 (9 yo).

Started off as my feet swelling and then proceeded to feel like barbed wire being wrapped around my legs and then being yanked from both ends.  Took a year for doctors to finally give me something to help with the pain, and during that time I'd take about 7 really hot showers a night and would average about 3 hours of sleep a day. 
That was back in 2012, Cymbalta and Lyrica worked really well together for about 2 years, then I got nothing but side effects. So then I was on just narcotic painkillers (was up to 50mcg Fentanyl patch and x4 15mg oxycodones per day) 

When I moved to Indiana from SC, none of the doctors there would write me scripts for any kind of pain killer. Was forced to go through withdrawals 3 separate times and It was fucking awful. 

Only options I was given was to first try a spinal cord stimulator, which did absolutely nothing for the week I wore it. Then my last and final option was an intrathecal pain pump. The trial for that was way less intense and just involved a needle to the spine with some morphine. It worked. So I had the surgery to implant the pump back in March and the roller coaster of pain has settled down quite a lot, but I've still had to take my ""not legally obtained"" pain meds at times to get through the day because my dumbass doctor STILL hasn't unlocked the option for me to be able to bolus when I have flare ups. 

Let me know if you have any questions, I'd be glad to answer."

How has neuropathy affected your life?,"Im 33 and have been officially a T1D since 2000 (9 yo).

Hopefully they will get approved in the UK at some point soon!

From the article I read it said when it comes to mealtimes, iLET uses a ‘meal announcement’ feature, with no need for precise carb counting. Users need to estimate the amount of carbs in their meal and input into the device as ‘small’, ‘medium’, or ‘large’.  

The device’s algorithm learns to respond to the user’s individual insulin needs and will independently decide on and order doses. 

This sounds like a big step forward in not needing to calculate carbs and getting it wrong!"

As to “all those little tweaks” that we do, there’s no way to do them. Period. You’re just supposed to trust the pump that it can handle everything (which it does well enough for most people most of the time). 

At a deeper level, I think BB fell into the trap of believing their own hype. Ed D is a smart guy, and throughout the design/development of the system, was out there selling it as the best thing since the advent of CGM. Heck, it doesn’t just have ONE algorithm- it has THREE! 

Lots of people online saw this great engineering professor who was motivated by his daughter having T1 out giving TED Talks and thought “THIS GUY is going to be the one who cracks the code!” Expectations among people who have been following the story/development of the pump became unrealistic, and now that it’s here, those people are going to be disappointed with the final product."

Post-alcohol meal,"Hi all, 
I'm having a hard time finding advices on how to handle a night out drinking a few drinks and how to handle a post drink meal. 
I already know the effect of alcohol on the liver and its effect on sugar breakdown, the fact that alcohol can make you drop low or skyrocket high depending on the beverage, how to be careful not to over do it with boluses while drinking, etc.. but I'm wondering about bolusing for a meal AFTER a few drinks. 

Typical situation : afterwork, you meet some friends, your sugar level is nice and steady, but you are walking a bit under the heat of summer so you eat a snack and put your pump on ease-off. Then you have a few beers (1.5l blond beer). 
A few hours pass by, your sugar went a bit high but it's steadily coming back to normal. Victory: no highs, no lows. 
You're home, you want to eat something. You can see your pump hasn't provided insuline for almost 2 hours but sugar level is steadily dropping (0.1mmol/l each 5-10 minutes)

So... Should you bolus normally for your meal ? Do you lower the bolus amount  (Like 25% less than usual) ? Do you keep your pump on ease off for the night ? 
Has anyone been experimenting enough to find some kind of pattern that works for them ? 
I usually get trapped in a paranoid scheme where I don't bolus at all and eat less than what I want/need (15gr), or don't eat at all, which of course makes me feel bad and low on energy the day after (and does not help with the hangover, even if that time it won't be that hard because of the small amount of alcohol consumed). 

On the screenshot below, yellow is the ease off period and blue is the insulin intake. I've just eaten 10Gr at 23:00, it starts raising, so I'm telling to myself ""ok the effect of alcohol is not that bad, I should bolus the usual amount"".
What would you do ?",https://i.redd.it/4nsc4fvkweab1.jpg,"Im on mdi. When I’ve had drinks and stopped drinking for the night, I normally don’t bolus for my food. Most of the time I don’t have to cover with basal. But tbh my bg drops kinda hard when I stop drinking"
What to eat (medium to long term) after glucagon?,"I had glucagon for the first time a couple days ago. I'm definitely stable now, didn't end up going to the hospital because it worked fine, but I've been feeling lousy since...kind of a ""last few days of being sick"" drained feeling.

&#x200B;

From what I understand, glucagon kind of dumps resources from my muscles and organs into my blood and rapidly converts it to boost my BG level. Does anyone have advice on what kinds of things I can eat so I can stop feeling kinda lousy? Or is this maybe psychosomatic at this point?

&#x200B;

To be clear - there is no emergency right now, it has been a couple days since I needed to use it, there aren't any indications of anything needing to be reported before my next (soon) endo appointment. I'm stable now, everything's fine, it just seems that the injection drained me a bit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14srfsq/what_to_eat_medium_to_long_term_after_glucagon/,I have nocturnal hypos several times per month where it triggers my body's natural glucagon response. The adrenaline screws up my body's glucose control for 2 days and i feel like shit. I have to eat low carb and have small snacks in between meals. Otherwise I get crazy spikes and then crazy dips during those 2 days.
Dexcom vs Libre,"My mom is thinking of switching me from the Dexcom G6 to the Libre 3. I got diagnosed as T1 in May, and fortunately my endo prescribed me the dexcom just a few days after diagnosis. I've gotten used to this device, but I wanna know how it compares to this other one.

1) How does the insertion and warm up process compare
2) Is one more/less comfortable to wear then the other
3) Which one can hold on longer (doesn't start falling off before sensor change)
4) Is one more accurate than the other
5) How different is the removal process
6) Do you really need to tap the libre with your phone to get a reading? Do you only get to see the current bs level, or does it also track it like the dexcom?
7) Is the libre compatible with any pumps?",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14slhkb/dexcom_vs_libre/,"1. Insertion and warmup are basically the same, just with different applicators. ~~Both 60 minute warmup~~. Libre has a 60 minute warmup, G6 is 2 hours. 

2. Libre 3 is far more comfortable than the G6 because it’s so much smaller and lighter. 

3. I’ve never had an issue with a Dexcom falling off, I’ve had a single Libre 3 fall off. Another was coming loose, but putting on an overpatch took care of it and it lasted all 14 days. 

4. They’re all about the same. I’ve used G6, G7 and Libre 3. Libre 3 is probably a tiny bit more accurate than G6 and a tiny bit less accurate than G7. [Here is a graph of a day comparing G7, L3, and blood meter readings](https://i.imgur.com/cuwymw9.png). The MARD I calculated for both was incredibly close both to each other and their published values. I think it was 7.5% for the G7 and 8.1% for the L3.


5. It’s exactly the same, just peel off the mesh patch around it and pull the filament out.


6. Libre 3 is a full CGM like the Dexcom, you only tap it to start the sensor. You don’t have to tap it again after that.

7. The libre 2 and 3 have been approved for use with pumps in the US and have partnerships with insulet (omnipod) and tandem. I think there are a couple abroad. There are also DIY loops supporting them."

Don't be afraid, 500 mg is really a small dose, and Metformin is a very safe drug.

Edit to add: the side effect I had at 2000mg was diarrhea. No nausea."

Welcome to the crappy club. 

You'll have to be your own advocate from now on. One important thing to start with is confirming the type of diabetes. Type 1 is treated with insulin (and literally nothing else is effective) where type 2s like me have a lot more options - oral drugs like metformin, other injectables like Ozempic or Trulicity... Make sure you are a type 2 diabetic first by asking for antibody testing and c-peptide testing. 

It's common for type 1s to be misdiagnosed as type 2s. Those type 2 drugs (other than insulin) will do jack if you have an autoimmune variant like type 1. Make sure you are being treated correctly by confirming the diagnosis!"

Side effects. Some meds you will have to take over the span of your life have lists of side effects that are longer than a roll of toilet paper. Lots is legal mambo Jambo not to be sued. Metformin is my enemy. I simply can't handle the GI issues I get. Mainly the runs. But that's me. So many take Metformin and are happy as clams. The effectiveness is fantastic, the long-term impact is great. There are people out there that take metformin as a life extender without being diabetic, because of a research study that says how great it is.

The other meds I take have much worse side effects possible and real life. But Now Google what the ingredients of a hot dog can do to you,or living in a big city. Life is managing risk. Being diabetic without taking meds will bring much worse side effects. Like a functional penis? Control your diabetes. Like to use your eyes? Take your meds. Attached to functional kidneys?  Want the ticker to tick as long as possible? Enjoy having toes? 

We all got dealt a hand of cards that's challenging. But there are tools and ways. Take it and see. If you are like me you will know within a month or two, the next med one step up from Metformin is worse in side effects btw.

I can tell you what I do, though,  and you can take that with a grain of salt.
If, for example,  I know that I have a regularly scheduled intense period of physical exercise,  I can in certain circumstances drop my long action by one unit in anticipation of it. Since my long action insulin mimics the work a pancreas does when im not eating,  i can think of it as being responsible for my  background rate of increase or decrease.  So if i raise or lower it, it will cause that trend to alter in a similar direction. 
It's important to note, though,  that right now I'm using Tresiba, which has a half life of 72 hours, so if I want to take advantage of that feature,  I need to start three days in advance.

So I run low a lot of the time- I lean on highly processed carbohydrates  ""fast sugar "" like Starburst or Twix (for example) when i start getting worried about dying.
However,  while they're good at sending you off on a rocket ship,  they aren't sustaining.  You can run high and then crash if you're engaged in manual labor and run mainly off fast sugar,  for instance. 
I use protein in my meals to provide a longer term, slow rate of increase. I work in a commercial kitchen,  and when I'm in the workweek,  my lunches are usually a juice box (there's my fast sugar), a bagel  (slower), and peanut butter (slowest, my protein). I'll usually administer my insulin halfway or even when the meal is complete,  just to make sure the curve for it starts _after_ my system starts processing the food."

You might consider asking about Tresiba, at some point.  Like i said, im prone to crashes, and after cycling through a number of flavors of long action,  Tresiba seems to be unusually good. The 72 hour half life is a noticeable difference"

Tips for moving to a snowy climate?,"My husband is type 1, and we’re planning on moving out of the west coast.

You'll probably loose power more than be snowed in.

You need to be prepared even if you're not diabetic.

Depending where you will be, have a generator and/or a wood stove.

Have enough reserve, food and water for a few days.

Make sure your husband is up to date with his medication, go get refills before they need to be refilled."

You learn how to walk carefully or you fall and break your butt, drive carefully or you find out what it’s like to drive sideways with no control. All pretty scary, if you’ve never experienced it. 

But here’s the thing: it rarely “just” happens. We always know days in advance that the storm is coming, so there’s time to prepare. Get to the store for bread and milk (another harrowing adventure), get ice-melt for your walkway, as well as stocking up on any diabetes meds you might need."

2. Sticking to a low carb diet but then decide to have a carby treat? Prepare for gas. Smelly gas. 

3. Explain to your wife/partner. She'll get it. 

4. Your sex drive may or may not dip. If it starts to, be honest with your partner. Also, ED is a real thing in this world. Talk to your doctor."

500mg didn't bother my stomach nearly as much as 1000mg though. I need a big meal to handle the 1000mg pills without any cramping or gas; oddly, the most unhealthy stuff (greasy stuff like burgers and fries) seems to make it a lot easier to tolerate, but then my buddy IBS shows up and says ""don't you dare get off that toilet... you're about to see some serious shit""."

Alternatives to the freestyle libre,"I had acidoketosis around a month ago, this haven't happened for at least ten years. So I decided to take my diabetes more seriously and started using the freestyle for monitoring. I've had issues with 5sensors in 3weeks. 
First one got detached after 4days of use while showering. 
Second expired after 8days 
Third expired after 8days 
Fourth expired after 1day 
5th was applied today but kept giving the 10minutes error, after contacting support they said that I should wait at least 2hours before scanning again, waited for two hours, and wanted to read but it expired as well.

So I wanted to know if there are any more reliable , maybe cheaper alternatives and if someone has been facing this issue too. I'm really disappointed in the freestyle especially for what it costs, I buy them at around 70usd in my country and Abbott doesn't have official sellers in here . 

Thank you all and keep that A1C where it should be!",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14sl747/alternatives_to_the_freestyle_libre/,"I dont have to pay for sensors but I found them as useless as you even when it did stay attached it was completely wrong. I stopped using them and apply dafne principles with a big of finger pricking to confirm my bg is in range. I wouldnt pay for them out of my own money and even felt bad for the government buying such dire equipment it must cost all taxpayers and I don't see why Abbott should get rewarded tbh.

Getting a tattoo as a diabetic ?,"Hello.

I (20M) would like to get tattoed a full sleeve. However, as a diabetic I'm wondering if if this a good or bad idea ? 

I've got a tattoo last summer (before being diagnosed) and the healing process, while being slower than expected, went very well. However, between a tattoo the size of the palm of my hand and a full sleeve, there's a difference. 

I've contacted a few tattoo artists/tattoo salons in my areas and talked about getting tattooed, and everything always go well until I mention I'm diabetic. Every tattoo artist/tattoo salon I've contacted told me they won't tattoo me because I'm diabetic and they don't want to risk anything. So, I'm wondering : can I still get tattoed as a diabetic ? If yes, any precautions I should take before and after the tattoo to reassure the artists ?

At my last blood drawn my A1C was at 6.1. The one before was at 10.4 (I just got diagnosed) and my doctor was rather pleased with how I manage my diabetes in my daily life, so I thought getting tattoed was fine as long as I regularly check my sugar level but with the responses from the tattoos artists, I believe I'm wrong.

Thanks in advance for any response.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14shy60/getting_a_tattoo_as_a_diabetic/,"I have 3 tattoos, including one large one and one that says ""type 1 diabetic"" so my artists had no problem with it.

I've contacted a few tattoo artists/tattoo salons in my areas and talked about getting tattooed, and everything always go well until I mention I'm diabetic. Every tattoo artist/tattoo salon I've contacted told me they won't tattoo me because I'm diabetic and they don't want to risk anything. So, I'm wondering : can I still get tattoed as a diabetic ? If yes, any precautions I should take before and after the tattoo to reassure the artists ?

At my last blood drawn my A1C was at 6.1. The one before was at 10.4 (I just got diagnosed) and my doctor was rather pleased with how I manage my diabetes in my daily life, so I thought getting tattoed was fine as long as I regularly check my sugar level but with the responses from the tattoos artists, I believe I'm wrong.

Thanks in advance for any response.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14shy60/getting_a_tattoo_as_a_diabetic/,"Here's the thing: I got two big tattoos on my arm done by the same tattoo artist when i was 18 and 19. Those took 2 to 3 hours each. I didn't even think of mentioning diabetes to my artist cause i was young and dumb. Nothing happened. I ate a big meal, made sure i'm not gonna get low, took very good care of my tattoo afterwards, and that was it. 

The artists don't want to take responsibility cause they know diabetics get infected more easily and if they faint or something else then it can be a whole different ordeal than that of a non diabetic. They might do this with many other illnesses, visible or not. 

If you make sure to go to a proffessional salon where they know how to handle a diabetic properly, nothing bad can happen. Or just play young and dumb like me and just go for it. But make sure to keep a close eye on your sugar levels"

(33 years old been t1 since 5). If your current tattoo had no problem healing I'd say there's probably a good chance you'll have no problem with a sleeve. Of course there's always a chance it doesn't heal well, but that happens to everyone. Make sure your a1c isn't too high (mine was around mid 7 when I got mine) and that you have an artist with a good reputation and uses CLEAN AND STERILE equipment.

To remove surprises, test your own blood glucose; test at least once per day (when waking up) and if you can, 2 hours after eating.

You could **estimate** your A1c from your blood glucose  with this simple formula.

with the glucose average in mg/DL.

A1c  = (46.7 + glucose average) / 28.7

My 3 months average is 97.2 mg/DL and the estimated A1c is 5.01% which is close to my last official A1c test which was 5.1%

Lipohypertrophy on stomach,"Hi fellow 'betes havers

I'm a type 1 of 26 years, and as a result have two giant lumps on my stomach which I always attributed to being a bit fat. I've only recently discovered this so am going to stop injecting there, but I'd like the lumps to take a hike. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Any tips for getting rid of the lumps? Online resources just say to stop injecting...",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14sf2l3/lipohypertrophy_on_stomach/,"With the diabetes education I was taught, you can't do anything about it cause there is no medication for it or anything at all. You just have to wait for it to be gone.

You have to do a rotation, don't continuously inject in one area, and try injecting in the thigh and arms.

I really don't use pumps since it isn't available in my country. So, I have been using insulin pens since I was diagnosed.  In my experience/opinion, it's best to inject around the thigh area. For me, I don't feel any pain at all. Plus, I inject a lot of units, like around 10-30 units, in just 1 injection, so I could really feel a lump. But it goes away on its own as long as you don't repeated inject in the same area or near the area. From what I know, if the case is severe, it takes months to go to normal.

Also, make sure you keep your insulin pens at the right temperature cause if you don't, it might expire if exposed to long to the wrong degree of temperature. Make sure also to not reuse needles."

I have the exact same and it makes me so sad. People always say « rotate » but if you’ve got those lumps, rotating won’t do anything at all, you’d have to stop injecting for 3-5 years to even see a difference. Honestly I’ve never heard of a cure. I went to plastic surgeons to see if liposuction might help (not that I wanted to resort to surgery but there seems to be no other option) but they said lipo would most likely not work as the fat is all scar tissue and might not bounce back. All they suggested was a mini tummy tuck and seeing as that costs 10k+ I unfortunately cannot afford it. I’m sorry I don’t have better news but do rotate other sites so the same thing doesn’t happen there (bum, lower back/side fat, arm, thighs, back of thighs)."

I am wondering if anyone knows of a good fitness/weight loss app that would allow me to connect my apple watch and dexcom data to track.

The Apple ""Health"" app allows this, but doesn't let you track food/ calories easily (only carbs) so I'm wondering if anyone else has found something like this.

Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14sh6ns/calorie_counting_app_to_connect_dexcom_data_and/,"I use mynetdiary, the data syncs from Apple Watch automatically. Their website says it will link cgm data from apple health. I really like mynetdiary, so

My diabetes may have saved my life (or almost ended it),"I have untreated T2. Thought I lost my state coverage back in COVID so have been dealing sans meds since. I found out a few months back I never really lost it, the state was just unclear what they were doing when they cancelled my EBT at the time. In the meantime I did get Blue Cross, so now I'm technically double covered, so yay?

Anyhow, over the past month or so my right leg started getting weird. Losing strength, losing feeling, but gradually. I finally decided id head in to Express Care to get it looked at on my next day off.

My body decided otherwise, and I almost fell at work and lost all sensation in my leg briefly. I ended up on the floor at work (of my own accord, no falling).

I get rushed to the ER, and explain my medical situation. They send me to get a CT scan to make sure I didn't have a stroke.

I didn't. Instead, parked right in the part of my brain that controls my leg is a 3cm brain tumor.

If I'd gone to my PCP or express care they'd have (probably) assumed it was the T2 like I did  and pmwould have put me back on my meds and never even considered a brain scan.

Our bodies are weird things, and I learned the very hard way not to just blame the diabetes in every health ailment.

My mother (non-diabetic) discovered her brain tumor by hitting the ground out of nowhere exactly like you. Hoping you get excellent medical care. It *could* be a long road so you’ll need all the support you can get. I’m voting on this being a life *saving* situation for you.

"Took a photo of this so I can show people when they say ""diabetes must be so much easier when you have a CGM""",,https://i.redd.it/x9upiygcp4ab1.jpg,Right.  Ever hit a vein while changing you pump site?  Shit happens.  You can't escape blood when your main problem is in your blood. It's never easy for anyone though.
"Took a photo of this so I can show people when they say ""diabetes must be so much easier when you have a CGM""",,https://i.redd.it/x9upiygcp4ab1.jpg,Yeah :( do you get circular bruises? Mine tend to be little circular galaxy-looking things so at least they look cool.
"Took a photo of this so I can show people when they say ""diabetes must be so much easier when you have a CGM""",,https://i.redd.it/x9upiygcp4ab1.jpg,Is the bruising really bad with a Libre 2? (Assuming that's what it is after looking up pictures) I've only used the Dexcom G6 and I don't think I've had any bruising so far. This sucker gets caught on so much stuff when I'm not paying attention though so I figured a flat CGM would be way better.
"Took a photo of this so I can show people when they say ""diabetes must be so much easier when you have a CGM""",,https://i.redd.it/x9upiygcp4ab1.jpg,"Oh how i can agree with this when i get multiple hypo alarms daily with a cgm but the few days i had it off, god ignorance was wonderful, i even got a great nights sleep. However, the cgm means im much more safer to go out on my own and im warned when im low so i can stop lows getting worse into potential seizures or confusion. But i do totally get the ignorance is bliss thing though with just testing a few times a day"

"Took a photo of this so I can show people when they say ""diabetes must be so much easier when you have a CGM""",,https://i.redd.it/x9upiygcp4ab1.jpg,"i'm the opposite.  When i don't/didn't have my CGM, i was always worried about where my BG was.  i think it's an aspect of my OCD.  i would finger prick constantly, to the point it's almost cheaper for me to pay out of pocket for the Libre than it was for me to buy test strips out of pocket.  (Insurance only covers the cost of 1 strip/day.)  Being able to just glance down at my wrist (or at my phone if i don't have my watch on) and see i'm okay has reduced my anxiety 1000 fold.  i'm not necessarily DOING anything with the information.  i just need to SEE it."
"Took a photo of this so I can show people when they say ""diabetes must be so much easier when you have a CGM""",,https://i.redd.it/x9upiygcp4ab1.jpg,I started referring to my Dexcom warmup as my blissful ignorance time.

Man, being without my cgm turned me into a living breathing anxiety attack. If I felt off a little bit and would normally just take a peek to see trends, now I was flying blind. But to be fair, my hypoglycemia has only increased exponentially since starting cgm. So a little bit of that anxiety stems from not really knowing where the hypoglycemia is coming from since I'm no longer on any diabetes meds and my a1c is now 5.7. Which I would jump for joy at, normally, but I haven't changed really anything from when it was 8 or 9. If anything, I eat more carbs now."

"Took a photo of this so I can show people when they say ""diabetes must be so much easier when you have a CGM""",,https://i.redd.it/x9upiygcp4ab1.jpg,"i see you have your diabetes in tight control, but for the sake of anyone else in your boat with allergies...

As far as i know, Libre products don't contain latex.  The metal parts should all be contained in the plastic shell.  i have a pretty bad allergy to most adhesives, but am not allergic to the adhesive used by Abbott.  i am allergic to skinprep, though, so i avoid using that.  i have also found clear overpatches that don't trigger my adhesive allergy.

Anyone interested might want to give it a try.  Abbott will give you the first one free, with their coupon, which can be found on their website.

The applicator means you don't deal with the needle directly.  And, once the device is applied, the needle is not left in.  Only a little filament.  You DO see the needle before application in the device, so i recommend not looking at the inside of the applicator before applying.  (Or do like i did and have someone else do that first application, and maybe the second one, too.  After that, for me at least, it was easy peasy, lemon squeezy.)

"Took a photo of this so I can show people when they say ""diabetes must be so much easier when you have a CGM""",,https://i.redd.it/x9upiygcp4ab1.jpg,"Valid questions - I have had 1 single sensor 'rip off' in the 3 years I have been using them - I was in a hurry to get out of a too tight tank top and the fabric somehow dragged across the area and got under the edge and yeeted. The adhesive holds it on pretty tightly. I think the only reason it yeeted was it had been summer, and I was hot and sweaty, so it may have loosened the sensor.

I have 2 main trends where I usually get low (right after I get my Lantus, and when it peaks at the 10-12 hour mark). The alarms really helped me dial in my ratios. I always have an a1c around 7 until alarms when managing my diabetes, but the alarms helped me bring it to low 6s consistently. So as someone with lot of long term complications (eyes, heart, kidneys) I am much more stable and doing less damage to my already damaged body.

Mentally, if I had to go back to finger sticks, I could do it, but I probably wouldn’t like setting alarms every few hours to test in the night (what I did before to avoid night hypos)."

The G7 filament is very short and it doesn’t hurt at all. On the Dexcom website it’s described as “ Soft as a kitten’s whisker.”

I think personally for me it's because the applicator for Libre you had to push the whole thing down to activate it, which meant it goes way harder and deeper. With Dexcom (g6 at least), there's a button that's pushed instead of the whole applicator. So what I do is stick the sensor/applicator on my skin, make sure it's nice and stuck, then pull back on the applicator just a little bit before pressing the button. I have more luck this way."

Diabetes and an ostomy,"So I seem to be having an odd pattern going, and I think it is because of how my digestion is handling life with an ostomy.

Anyways I avoid nuts almost completely now, I had several painful blockages from those.

No matter how fast the output I had no problem putting on weight even without a colon and very short transit time. 

If you have high output, keep up with topping off electrolytes,  hiking/walking seemed to be the only thing that really slowed mine down(temporary), Imodium just caused me back pain. Foods with high starches, pectin, and fiber/psyllium fiber were recommended as I recall.

I had the ileo reversed, but even the reversal is still high output.  

I'm now taking wegovy(same drug as ozempic) to lose some weight and also help control my bg but it also works by slowing digestion down which for me was an additional benefit and reduced how frequently I had to go."

Any diabetics with tongue piercings?,"I've wanted one since I was a teenager, but am worried about it not healing well. Tongues can be pretty risky -- especially if they swell and block your airways. 

I have a pretty rough history when it comes to healing from piercings. My first set of ear piercings had to get done eight times. My second set took nine tries, and only one pulled through. 

Weirdly, with tattoos I've had no issues. Since my ear piercings were done at Claire's back in the day, I'm wondering if that was the issue? Holding on to a little bit of hope that getting the piercing done at a shop might go a little smoother. 

I'm not someone who likes to take huge risks when it comes to physical healing, and if I do end up trying I'll likely get another ""test"" piercing done on another area of the body to see if healing is any easier. 

Are there any type ones out there who have gotten a tongue piercing? How did the healing process go?

Ultimately, you’ll have to give it a try. Make sure your blood sugars are under control and you keep your mouth VERY clean after you get it done. Don’t play around with it with your teeth, etc, and that’s your best bet to help it heal!"

How are you treating the low?  The standard of care is 15g of fast acting carbohydrates (4oz juice, 3-4 glucose tablets) and recheck glucose 15 minutes later to see if retreatment is needed?

• Yes I'm testing and adjusting my sugars manually.

• the numbers vary but usually I try to be at moderate levels and eat a slow carb to burn overnight.

• I manage them by testing every 10-15 minutes but I find that it takes a solid hour of fast + slow carb intake to actually see upward movement.

My main issue is that I wake up in a panic and my numbers are plummeting. An hour and a half ago I woke up feeling wrong and checked my sugars. They were at 15.9 mmol/l which I recognise is high but over the next 30 minutes they dropped to 11.7mmol/l as I ate a significant amount of jam and granola bars.

It will put out adrenaline to wake you up and tell your liver to dump glucose into your blood to stop the low.  

11.7 and 10.7 are still high numbers.  No need to panic with those numbers.

The normal range is 4.4-7.8. Low is 3.8 or lower.

Have you discussed this panic feeling with your doctor?  

My guess is that you have had high glucose (16-22) for a long time.  The drop into the 10 range makes you feel bad.  This is a false low.  If you can stay in the 10 range for a week, the feeling will go away, then if you can get into the 7 range, you may have false low feelings again.  Stay there a week and those will also subside."

\-If you can, get a CGM. Being on insulin now, it really really helps manage lows. 

\-Consider a pump or at least talk to your doctor or a rep. Multiple Daily Injections (MDI) works better for some, I am not one of them

\-Continue being active, it will make managing your glucose better. Just always keep something sweet with you

\-If you can, see a therapist. There is an existential dread that comes with the diagnosis of a chronic disease. Talking with family and friends is great but if the angst/anxiety is higher than normal, then talk to a professional. 

\-Allow diabetes to reshape/reconsider your priorities. We hear and read amazing stories about diabetics who run marathons or achieve whatever lofty goal may seem out of reach. That's awesome but consider if those things actually matter to you. Don't let the diagnosis make you feel like you have to be an outlier, let it help you decide what actually matters out of the finite life we have

\-Give yourself a lot of grace in the beginning and consider a higher ""normal"" range as you continue to find out what works for you.

\- Listen to other diabetics but always with a grain of salt. It's such an individual disease what works for some will not always work for you and that's completely ok"
20M With Type-1,"Yesterday I got diagnosed with type 1 diabetes after a few days of heavy fatigue, frequent urination and blurry vision which all came out to be symptoms of High Blood Sugar. I’m considered to be the healthiest in my family in terms of diet and Active life so everyone around me is pretty much shocked by the diagnosis. I’m currently still at the hospital and will be meeting with guidance counselors and specialist to help adjust me to the new lifestyle.

God Bless 🙏🏾",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14r6swc/20m_with_type1/,"Look into getting a CGM. It has definitely been the biggest difference maker for me. The 2 main CGMs out there are Dexcom and the Freestyle Libre. There is also a podcast that I have found super helpful and informative called the juicebox podcast, tons of great info and tips on there. Lastly I would say if you have access, look into getting an insulin pump. There are a few different kinds and it requires a little more research and dealing with your care team than getting the CGM but can be so worth it for alot of people (not everyone). Some of the pumps can work with the CGMs to calculate and administer insulin without you having to be as involved, which can save a ton of mental load. There will also be lots to learn about different foods amd timing insulins but that will all come with a bit of time and experience. If you have any questions about exercise and managing blood sugars at any point, shoot me a message and I will try to help with whatever info from my experience I can offer. Best of luck to you my friend."

God Bless 🙏🏾",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14r6swc/20m_with_type1/,"I got diagnosed with Type 1 at age 18 on my first day at university. Spent the first night of Uni in hospital and not on campus drinking and partying like everyone else. I did get released from hospital and back on campus the day after however and, with insulin injections, I went on to have a pretty normal uni life thereafter. Now, 25 years later I am still here living pretty much a normal life or as normal as life can be for a type 1.

Today you have the benefits of CGMs and hyper-fast acting insulins (which 25 years ago did not exist). So you have it good now compared to 25 years ago just as I had it good back then compared to Type 1s 25 years before my diagnosis.

You also now have the availability of insulin pumps but they are not a must. A CGM together with hyper-fast insulin will give you pretty good 80%+ TIR already (specially if you are continuously active and lead a healthy lifestyle).

If your living situation (i.e. country/economies, etc.) doesn't offer you things like pumps, CGMs and hyper-fast insulins it is still not the end of the world as long as insulin in general is always there for you (Just like it was the only thing there for T1Ds 25 years ago).

You will have ups and downs as you settle in and will forever be asking yourelf ""why me?"" but, it is important to keep things in perspective and remember that, there will always be others out there in more unfortunate positions than you. Stay strong, live healthy and live."

God Bless 🙏🏾",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14r6swc/20m_with_type1/,"As others have said, T1 diabetes has nothing to do with diet, exercise or overall health. About the only thing you might have done to avoid it would have been to live in a hermetically sealed bubble, protected from all viruses and other sources of infection, for your entire life, since it was probably some sort of infection that triggered your immune system to destroy your pancreatic beta cells.

I wrote the following on another thread from a mum of a recently diagnosed boy:

*""The first thing you need to know is that managing diabetes is a lot more than just balancing food (particularly carbs) and insulin. There's so much more to it. Because it's so complex, it's impossible to have perfect control all of the time - imperfect control should just be accepted as inevitable and not as a failure, so long as the right intention was there.*  
*the second thing you need to know is that, despite the complexity, it IS manageable, especially with the technology available now. Also, the more you research, learn and understand about the disease, all of the different impacts it has on various metabolic processes, how insulins of various kinds work (and how that is different to how insulin from an unimpaired pancreas works), etc. the more manageable it becomes - and it's fasinating to learn.""*

I've had T1 for 32 years and had a very full and, fankly, great life. Don't let diabetes stop you from doing what you want, don't fear highs and lows, just learn to avoid them and deal with them, when they inevitably occur. You will need to be much more aware of what you eat, what you do, your overall health, etc. but you get used to it - it's just something extra that you need to do, it's not taking anything away from you except maybe just a little bit of sponteneity. But, hey, so does having kids or even a dog."

Tresiba is very very steady, I never saw peaks. Some people take Levemir twice a day. I would definitely talk to your doctor about breaking up your basal doses though. 

Your fast acting insulin is what you may want to bring with you depending on the duration of your outing. That’s what you’ll take with meals. If you’re not going to eat where you’re going then I wouldn’t worry about bringing it. 

But if you’re going to a bbq or any event where you’ll be eating there, then yes you’ll want to bring your fast acting.

I have a small bag and ice pack I bring with me if I’m going to be out more than 2-4 hours. Even if I don’t plan on eating out or anything, it’s nice to have it with me if I get hungry 😁

God Bless 🙏🏾",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14r6swc/20m_with_type1/,"You will probably find that you don’t have to eat as many calories when taking insulin and weight lifting. You’re body is now going to have way more Insulin than it did before and the insulin we inject is just as effective at bringing glucose and amino acids into the muscle cells. 

I was 187 when I got diagnosed and am now 204. I do Peloton weight training so it’s not focused as much on mass or density training but I’ve still gotten a lot stronger since

Ben Tzeel and DiabetesStrong are good resources for weight lifting and being type 1 

My biggest suggestion is to wait on fast acting insulin after a workout, I typically workout between 5 and 6pm after work, if I eat dinner at 7 and bolus my normal amount, I go low after an hour regardless of the carbs in my meal. So pushing dinner to 8 or taking a lot less fast acting insulin helps prevent that 

One really nice benefit to being on multiple injections is you can workout fasted in the morning as long as you’re in range. Most basal insulins aren’t going to have you go low in the morning so I always walk fasted to help burn fat

Some people go high when weight lifting, I’ve never had that problem. Squats and anything chest/back related usual bring my sugar down 

And no problem, if there’s any advantage to having diabetes, it’s being able to help others who want to get control of it themselves"

God Bless 🙏🏾",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14r6swc/20m_with_type1/,"For snacks I like nuts, cottage cheese, plain yogurt (you can add fruits, berries are best, if you're in a good range) lower fat cheeses, turkey jerky. You're pretty young and probably don't have high cholesterol/triglycerides yet but it's something to be aware of in the future so keeping things on the lower fat side is better. Diabetes just lends itself to increased lipids. Don't get too carried away with Keto foods, I did a couple years ago and I did not realize how much saturated fat is in those prepackaged foods and my lipid panel showed a big increase. 

You don't typically want to take any insulin with snacks cause that can lead to insulin stacking. Thats when you take fast acting insulin too close to your previous dose. Most fast actings peak at 2 hours, so wait until 3 hours to take any correction dose. If you stack you run a higher chance of having a low BG and can be harder to correct since you're now battling new insulin.

For going out to eat, this is where I personally feel the pump is better than being on MDI. If you have a pump, especially some of the new ones that are essentially a closed loop system (this means your pump is connected to your CGM and gives insulin based on those readings), you can just eat. Your pump will correct as your BG goes up. 

Since you're on MDI though, I would suggest taking your insulin in the car, if you feel uncomfortable doing it in public or a bathroom. I personally, could never do it in a bathroom, just felt gross. Most fast acting insulins take 15-30 minutes to kick in so it's typically enough time before the food reaches your table. Only caveat to that, if the restaurant is busy and food does not come in time, that insulin is still going to get to work so you may go low before or high after the meal since it was mistimed.

I have never taken it but there is an inhaled fast acting insulin called Afrezza. I believe it acts incredibly fast and would certainly be more discreet than a pen. 

But yeah you can still go out to eat and to movies and stuff it just takes a little more planning and trying to get that timing right. And if you mistime, you mistime. It can always be corrected and you'll have a better idea of what to do next time"

I’ve already sat and done the reflecting, just wanted to know everyone else’s experience with the disease and ANY advise would be greatly appreciated.

I know that statistic can be scary, but find solace in the sense that you did not do anything to 'cause' this. 

T1 can have an effect with our sugars etc, however with planning it is definitely possible to have a completely healthy pregnancy. I know a girl who didn't know she was pregnant, type one for a large chunk of her life, and she had a healthy baby boy. It can and DOES happen every single day. And one day, you will be a part of the statistic of a healthy diabetic pregnancy. You'll be alright.

Something to note, after my procedure my sugars went a bit crazy due to low iron. May be an idea to get your iron levels checked and/or have someone around for assistance just in case. 

Love you, internet stranger, I'll be rooting for you."

I hope to comfort you by telling you that as many as 26% of all pregnancies end in miscarriage. That's 1/4! Your miscarriage likely had nothing to do with your t1d status. Your a1c is pretty good! 

I can't tell you any uplifting stories, but I didn't want you to think that you have no chance at carrying a pregnancy to term, because that's not true at all! Usually pregnancies end because something went wrong with the program... DNA didn't replicate correctly, organs aren't generating correctly, etc. 

If you want to try again, I suggest making an appointment with an obgyn who specializes in high-risk pregnancy and is hopefully very well versed in type 1 diabetic pregnancy management. Ask your endocrinologist for recommendations, they are likely to know some people. Make an appointment with them before you get pregnant and have them help you get there. And start taking a pre-natal vitamin every day now, not after you get pregnant. 

I wish you peace and many children!"

First and foremost, I am so sorry for your loss. I have no medical advice (not a doctor nor will I pretend to be one) in regards to pregnancy and T1D , but know that it isn’t your fault and unfortunately for many reasons we may not understand, miscarriages could occur. I struggled with infertility and my husband and I decided to do IVF as a result. 

I’m currently 35.5 weeks pregnant as a T1D of 23 years. It has been a rollercoaster keeping everything under control. One thing my Endo told me that stuck with me is that any A1C under 7 will promote a healthy pregnancy. That’s not to say stay at or around 7 and wing it, but know that it’s more likely than not you and baby will be healthy as long as it’s under 7.

My first pregnancy ended up in miscarriage at 7 weeks and I'm now pregnant with 35 weeks and a C-section booked in 2 weeks.

All I can say is be kind to yourself! Most miscarriages are just to chromosomal issues and they can happen to anyone. It's almost impossible to know what happened unless it's a bit more advanced and the doctors can test.

As some people have said. The miscarriage statistics are really high. Not many people talk about that but the moment the first one in a group opens up, then you start hearing stories. 
The majority of women who miscarriage go on to have healthy babies the next time. 
My own mother had a miscarriage and then went to have 3 kids. 

Depending on which country you are you may be able to get tests after one miscarriage, and they can help you if you have another underlying issue like thyroid or clotting issues. But in the UK you need to have recurrent miscarriages to be referred to these tests. 

Take your time to grieve on your own. Rely on your partner and talk a lot about how you feel. Know that you didn't do this to yourself. It just happened. 
Seek help from friends if you are comfortable, or speak to a therapist.

Once I fell pregnant again, I could tell because my insulin resistance went up like a week before I could test. As soon as I found out I contacted the midwife services and got advice! 
Sometimes they may give you some medicine! 

It has been hard for me to relax, but every time I feel a kick it reminds me is so worthy and I feel happy.

Pregnancy is hard for almost every woman and as noted, many aren't carried to term. As a diabetic dad on the upper end of the age spectrum for parents (with a wife who is also on the older side) I feel for you!

We ended up having to do 2 rounds of IVF to get pregnant and after the first unsuccessful round, my wife was very disappointed and really struggled with the idea of trying again.   


However, after a couple year break, we did try again and ended up transferring 2 eggs from the IVF procedure. One miscarried, but the other is now a 5 year old kid that is probably smarter than his  parents put together. (Sorely lacking in world knowledge, but he's pretty sure that doesn't matter.)

Not exactly your situation, but similar in some respects. My wife's only regret is that we didn't try the 2nd round of IVF sooner. 

I also had a co-worker that was T1 and she had a little girl without any real complications. There are a lot more factors in a pregnancy than your blood sugars. Yep, you have to manage them and do all the regular stuff, (which it sounds like you do a pretty good job of) but you shouldn't blame this on your blood sugars.

Take some time to mourn and feel your loss. If you need to, go get some counseling. 

My advice: don't let this be the end of your road. I love my kid to death and he's the best thing I have ever done."

Fwiw I’m a senior citizen now And my mom was T1 …just after insulin was invented. This was way before HBA1c or even finger sticks and yes she did miscarry before me and I think she was in the hospital as a precaution towards the end….but…here I am (not gonna tell you how many years old I am but ) I was born and gave my t1 mom tons of grief as a teenager naturally 

I keep thinking monitoring and care must be so much better now I’m hoping things improve for you

And I can’t take away the hurt no matter how much I wish I could do that for you. All I can say is feel the feelings. If you’re like I was, I was numb… for a couple weeks to be honest. And then… rage. I cannot even explain the absolute, never ending pit of rage. Not anger, this surpassed it. And I tried to shove it down. But. That doesn’t go well. I absolutely lost it the one night at my husband. He is an amazing man, he took it, and I just ended up bawling and he hugged me and cried with me and it was all very emotional. But I needed that release. I needed to feel it. I needed to feel something at that point. So. Feel it all. It’s going to hurt. And suck. But it’s better than bottling it up. And don’t feel like you need to rush to try again. Be gentle with yourself ❤️"

Looking for advice on G7 insertion site/pain - T1 32 male - see post for details,"Hello all, 

Some context. I've been using the G6 in my abdomen for years without issue. I just made the switch to G7 today - imagine my excitement when my endo told me it was finally available for me! 

Cut forward to today, I've got the app set up and I'm about to apply the sensor - was pretty surprised and incredulous when it suggested using the back of my upper arm as as a site. I'm a very lean/thin guy, and have almost no body fat in my arms. I felt this was certain to be painful. I Googled though and Dexcom's website says that I should use this for optimal performance.

Well, I went ahead with the arm site, and holy shit this is painful. Feels like I hit a nerve or something - jolts of pain radiate throughout my upper arm and into my shoulder when I put the slightest pressure on the sensor. 

Two questions I have for everyone who has experience with the G7 system -

1) is it okay go use my abdomen as an adult? Can anyone tell me their experiences using their G7 with their abdomen?

2) I've got to deal with this thing for 10 more days - two hours in and it's still painful as hell. Can I expect this to abate at any point or am I fucked until this session is over?

Welcome any experiences from anyone with their G7s. 

Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14rtmbf/looking_for_advice_on_g7_insertion_sitepain_t1_32/,I would take it out and call Dexcom to get a replacement. I had constant pain inserting my G6 and the G7 is the most painless insertion that I don’t even know it’s happening. Mine even bled pretty heavily on my last insertion and I didn’t feel a thing putting it in.

I did have very accurate results while using it on my arm.  The detailed report is available on the web but this is a quick summary:

Overall mean absolute relative difference for arm and abdominal sensors were 8.2% and 9.1%; %15/15, %20/20, and %30/30 agreement rates for each site were 89.6%, 95.3%, and 98.8% (arm) and 85.5%, 93.2%, and 98.1% (abdominal), respectively.

 First day I get mixed results - sometimes real wonky.  I usually calibrate after 10 - 12 hours and sometimes on day 2.  As others have mentioned, I insert my new sensor but don't activate for 10 - 12 hours.  This mitigates the length of time with wonky readings."

What you should look for is patterns: for example, are you going low or high most days at a certain time? 

Until you get the hang of patterns, and recognize what might be causing them (more exercise, skipped meals, lack of sleep, illness, etc) you should consult with your doctor. You do want a lower range over time, and if 33 units of lantus is keeping you 100-150, that’s the dose for you! But if you’re regularly waking up and you’re 55 at 2am or something like that, you may need to adjust the dose or the timing of the dose."

I know my comment doesn't help your specific situation but hopefully adds some weighted balance to the positives/negatives of CGMs overall.

It'd be interesting to one day find out why CGMs work great for some but not so much for others. i.e. is it due to environment conditions, body chemical compositions, how they are being applied, or something else entirely."

How can this thing be on the market yet so innacutate?",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14r8x1x/why_is_the_freestyle_libre_2_so_shit/,"After the first 24 hours it's NOT that inaccurate unless there something wrong with the site, the actual instance or user errors like wrong insertion or compression or stuff like that, which happens.  

All the CGM brands have to go get tested and approved by an independent party and demonstrate the same standard of accuracy.    

There's also situations where you EXPECT a big difference between a finger prick and a CGM reading, and where this is CORRECT.  They don't measure the same thing, CGMs measures interstitial glucose level, which is the glucose found in the fluid between the cells, while your meter measures blood glucose levels.  

That means that if you shove some carbs down your yapphole they'll FIRST appear in your blood, and you don't expect the CGM to respond until 15-20 minutes later because until then there's still no change in the interstitial glucose level.   

You can test this yourself when you're stable and low sometime. Scarf down some 100gi carbs and finger prick every 5 minutes and compare to your CGM-readings.  You'll see a sudden spike in your meter, but NO reaction from the CGM until 3-4 fingerpricks later at which point your finger prick readings could be even higher.  

Try to imagine fingerprints as the first cart on a rollercoaster,  while the CGM is the last one."

I've found that the sensors are usually pretty reliable after the initial calibration period. One thing that can help is applying the next one in advance of the current one running out. A day or two ahead is best, but even 4-5 hours can help IME. That gives the new sensor a chance to settle in, and for the initial inflammation to go down some. Then just activate the new one once the other expires."

She turns 4 this month and I’ll only have two hours to have a party with her and someone watching us lol, I know that should be motivating me to be doing everything I can but I also know if I don’t take care of myself mentally I’ll go down a dark path.. I’ve had anxiety and depression since I was 19 and I’m 28 now. I take meds for it and have it under control mostly. Not as of late but It probably stems from being abused a lot as a child and my real mother leaving when I was born. Luckily I had the motivation two years ago to take my ex to court myself and do all the paperwork myself, just to get those two hours a week. But going up her attorney and getting shafted by the court as usual it kills you inside.. I’ve never hit any women and hardly raise my voice. She just decided to stop taking her meds and flipped. Took off never to be seen again.. I just always promised myself my daughter would never have to wonder where I was and now every weekend she asks me why she can’t stay the night with me or come to my house. It fucking sucks so much…"

But think about it like this,

You want to be there for your daughter you need to take your meds and work on your diabetes. 

You want to be there for your daughter so you need to work on your mental health, take your meds talk to a a psychologist/psychiatrist.

You want to be there for your daughter, no job is below you; wash dishes, shovel shit, stock shelves. 

You want to be there for your daughter; get all the above in order then go back and fight for more time to see her. 

When she ask whats going on, be honest with her. I mean she's 4 so she isn't going to necessarily understand the nuances of specifics. But tell her, ""well Daddy wants to spend as much as time with you as possible, and in order to do that I need to get healthy."" Don't hem and haw, and don't lie, and don't bad mouth your ex. Don't put your daughter between the both you that will only make it worse. 

Everything you do now is for your daughter. It isn't for you, if she is going to be the driving force behind getting shit done, use it. 

I am using my kids and my wife in the same manner, they are my reason to get in gear. I want to see what my kids become in a few years. I want to see if I get grandkids at some point. I want to spend as much time as humanly possible with my wife before the inevitable. 

I didn't use to be that way. I used not to care, and think things may be better without me in the way. I was angry and depressed, but little by little I'm changing it. 

It's like rolling a boulder up a hill. You can't do it all in one go, you need to roll that thing over, let it settle, take a break and breath. Then do it all over again, and again, and again and again until you get that boulder to the summit. That will be all of your work accumulated into one gigantic achievement, and a giant FUCK YOU to the world. That's what I'm doing man, rolling that boulder a little at a time each day. I'm making progress. That's what you need to do in order to keep going, just make some progress."

Drinking plenty of water and a nutrient-rich diet could also be beneficial. 
As for the insulin causing your blood sugar to drop, it's important to pair your insulin intake with regular meals and monitor your carbohydrate intake. Regular exercise could also regulate your blood sugar levels but make sure not to overdo it. 

But remember, these are merely suggestions. The best course of action would be to have a thorough discussion with your specialist. Lost blood readings and miscommunication can be frustrating, so make sure to double-check all details about your appointment. It might be helpful to note down all the questions and concerns you have before you meet the specialist to discuss further about your situation.

They would most likely look for antibodies to see if they were diabetic, either diagnosed or undiagnosed. If they don’t have antibodies, then it would come down to what food is in their system. A full stomach would be strange for their BS to crash that hard, unless they live by sugar-free. 

So basically, you’d have a body full of insulin(extremely low BS) but no symptoms that would cause such a crash. 

Plus, idk about puncture marks. I get bruises/scabs where I do my injections. They usually appear 12-24 hours after I inject. A dead body might not fully heal from the puncture marks, so it might be visible. Thus foul-play can be assumed. 

Im still learning about all this so don’t my word as gospel truth."

But it's the only place I could think of that's likely to have a population of people who know anything about insulin biology.

Thanks for the link!  Summary findings for those who care:

* it's possible to detect synthetic insulin in post-mortem blood samples, which would be pretty conclusive evidence if you found it in someone with no history of taking insulin.
* you can look at the ratio of insulin to c-peptide to determine if the insulin level is artificially high, though this is more challenging given they both degrade relatively quickly after death."

Symptoms before they die, sure.  Not the case here though, they found the victims after they had died and specifically talk about toxicology reports.

Does insulin have a smell?

Glycogen I would have thought is too naturally variable to tell you much.  But maybe heightened levels of glycogen synthase along with low levels of BG?"

He was initially trying to write it as 15 units a day and specified 3 boxes; pharmacy called me as soon as they saw it and asked if I had updated insurance, I gave them the info, they said ""yeah no way will insurance approve this... it's a nearly 300 day supply at that dose, and that dose is really low"". I guess he either doesn't have a lot of patients on insulin, or he's used to prescribing vials/syringes (I can't handle seeing a syringe).

In reality my dosage was significantly higher when I was on Novo*lin* (sometimes over 150 a day), but now that I'm on Huma*log\** I'm using around 50-60, sometimes quite a bit less - today I've only used 13 short acting (skipped lunch, only breakfast and dinner, and I'll have a snack before bed that'll probably require 1-2 more). I knew I could get him to alter it and resubmit it if I needed more, and that insurance will let me refill when I have 14 days left.

My insurance only covers 1 month unless I have it filled through @%# Express Scripts. I don't want my insulin sitting in a hot parcel locker or shipping truck for days. I'm probably going to have to do mail order for long acting eventually, since those come 5 to a box too, . Currently a friend gives me his extra Lantus (which my insurance doesn't cover). 2 pens lasts me just shy of a month, and pharmacies aren't allowed to do single pens.

\*Italics to point out I was using the old school \*lin insulin for awhile since I didn't have insurance (you can get Novolin OTC at most Walmart pharmacies) - the analogs (Novolog, Humalog, etc) have been far more effective for me, I just couldn't afford them until I got insurance again."

For my own example, pretty much every insulin in the formulary for my plan has ""QL"" listed next to it (quantity limited) - that's with me being on one of the Gold plans. The only one I see that's not QL is Huma*lin* R (the old school ""short"" acting stuff from the 70s/80s). If I wanted a \*lin, I can get it OTC at Walmart or the grocery store that fills most of my prescriptions.

There's a few of the super long acting ones that aren't QL, but they need prior authorization.  Some diabetic stuff is both QL and prior auth (Dexcom stuff for example)."

Genuinely curious. I should get 6 Humalog pens a month going by the RX, but the pharmacy gives me a single box and sends it to insurance as a 25 day fill.

Even 15 would be 3 boxes, which is a reasonable amount IMO. I can easily see insurance approving that if the RX is written properly.  Something like 10 or 15 boxes for a month would probably have them kick it back and tell you to switch to a U-200 or U-500, I would think."

And everytime we go out to eat or have a family get-together they constantly get tired after carby meals and complain about how much weight they are going to gain from eating all the calories. It makes me sad to see them slowly killing themselves with poor eating habits with little regard to their own health. But i remind myself that I'm not responsible for others' health. 

If anything my diabetes diagnosis was a good wake up call. I am currently in the best shape of my life at 31.

I now have the opposite problem where people are shocked at how lean and healthy I am from eating nothing but protein and fat. Because they still think fat makes people fat."

There sre good calories and bad calories.  1500 of non nutritious calories versus the same for a well balanced diet are going to give a different result.

edit: literally just came across a youtube short of creme brulee donuts.... dead",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14qdyau/looking_at_people_eat/,"The study they referenced shows an increased rate of cancer among those consuming aspartame as opposed to sugar at a rate of 1.15x. Just significant enough to demonstrate correlation, but a causal link has not been determined. This is why they classify it as a ""possible"" link. This information in and of itself might be enough to sway someone's risk assessment, and I wouldn't blame them. However, when it comes to serving as an alternative for already known health concerns, I would assume you're missing a lot of information to think it's not - at the very least - a decent replacement.

For one thing, a general theme in this thread is about how reducing carbs is beneficial to your health overall.  One commenter mentioned how a friend of theirs lost 50 pounds by cutting out liquid calories. A lot of people don't know that 4-8% of all cancers are directly attributed to obesity. So, in this case, even if you completely ignore the near limitless benefits of losing that much weight and focus solely on the cancer bit, by reducing weight you're effectively eliminating a massive and direct known risk to cancer. If you're using something that has a *slight potential* risk to assist, that's a a massively beneficial tradeoff of risk.

And, again, that beneficial tradeoff only gets more beneficial when you consider how much healthier you are in every possible aspect just by losing that weight. Or by not gaining it.

When it comes to diabetics, it's pretty clearly a better alternative than drinking a sugar drink whether you are a healthy weight or not. Like the other guy in your replies said, ""I'd take that over my blood sugar going to 400"". Long term *potential* of *maybe* having *risk* of cancer seems really insignificant vs the immediate *guarantee* of feeling shitty *right now* and also having complications down the line. This one isn't even risk assessment, there's no risk of your blood sugar going up when you drink sugar water, it just does, and  it does so immediately. There's also no risk of feeling shitty when it happens, you just do, it's a guarantee.

Long story short: taking care of your blood sugar and personal well-being is far more effective than basing your diet off of possible low risk extremes."

Not everyone who eats a carb heavy diet is pulling their buttocks along in a wagon.

She doesn't exercise except strolling in her local park. Lives in the US, too.

The two things she doesn't do is 1) snack, and if she does snack the amt is what you give to an infant/toddler. Drinks only the occasional green tea and the rest is water. 

Also, she's not from the clean plate club. Never over eats.

I have a ton of emotional baggage with food. Had food insecurity growing up, and disordered eating. It's interesting to watch someone who treats food as only food, without all the entanglements.

In most cases where we test stuff in medicine, we're not actually testing the thing, but a symptom.  

For instance, a pregnancy test doesn't actually test if you are pregnant, it tests if you have over a certain amount of a specific hormone (you have probably heard about hCG). Now the most common reason a girl of fertile age who has had unprotected heterosexual sex and missed a period should happen to have hCG in her system is because she's pregnant.  

But that's not the only reason you can have hCG in your system. Several types of cancer and other illnesses can cause you to produce hCG.  

It's the same with ketones. We t1s are not actually testing for the problem, we're testing for ketones. Now shedding ketones like crazy when we're high for a while is a sign we're galloping towards ketoacidosis, and that's very bad.  

But shedding ketones like crazy isn't necessarily a sign you're about to go into acidosis though. You can have a perfectly low and healthy blood sugar, but when your body starts using fat for fuel instead of carbs your ketone count goes up. That's why if you test you'll have a higher count before breakfast than after a meal containing a decent amount of carbs."

Ate a lot of carbs, but never overate. Not fat though I never exercised. I am sure I was still prediabetic back then.

Just because she's a small size and skinny doesn't mean she's healthy or may not have a high body fat percentage (and even metabolically obese). A lot of Asian people are skinny because they don't work out, so they barely have any muscles though they might still have body fat. That's why they can get diabetes at lower BMIs, which really doesn't mean anything because you can be skinnyfat and be at a ""healthy"" BMI while a bodybuilder who is only 9% bodyfat can be considered overweight BMI because muscles weigh more than fat.

Your SIL might be thin but unless she works out, she probably lacks muscle definition without the ""toned"" look that healthy people have. And possibly a puffy stomach due to the visceral fat wrapped around her abdomen - which a lot of skinny Asian people I knew had who ate high carb and never exercised. But they were ""skinny"" and ""underweight""."

As a hiring manager, here are the reasons why:

1. If I get hired and ever need something under ADA or FMLA, the company can't play ""we didn't know about that."" You don't need to disclose **what** disability you have, if you don't need accommodations from day one. But if somewhere down the line you do need something, you can lean hard on ""my application stated that I have a disability, which now requires (thing)"".

Depending on the person, it can be more or less manageable on a day to day basis. I can't work any job that requires consistent physical labor and on the days where my IT job requires lots of equipment moving, I have to be able to take breaks and have snacks available to prevent lows and take lunch by 1:30.

But this is a legal discussion and you were not so clear on your intent.  Many type 1s for longer years are disabled legally or will be in future years.  If you can no longer work and rely on ssdi disability insurance to survive as i do, due to a real disability, it is not helpful for much of society thinking that diabetes is not any kind of problem, and only those fat and 300 pounds eating candy every day have the slightest of problems.  Even the ADA has said diabetes is not a disability, in the interest of course of helping diabetics to be able to have jobs and work, but this is a horrible statement for them to make, as again it IS a disability for many, regardless of how well they took care of their disease after 20,30,40 years.  Diabetes used to be easy to prove as a disability but ironically, the Democrats during the Obama administration changed all the SSDI rules in terms of diabetes.  I could barely walk 40 feet a day for a full year.  My joints are all misaligned and deformed.  I have other problems too, yet it too 3 years finally appearing before a judge and showing him photos of my deformed legs to finally grant full disability.  This process is a great injustice to humanity and those truly suffering.  So yes, i have a few opinions on this topic, grounded in truth and experience."

Pharmacy says they would have to order it and it would take too long.  Would anyone know where I can get some long lasting insulin. 

Thank you",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14r8nk4/t1d_in_italy_need_insulin/,Same thing happened to me in italy. I would just take a little short acting before bed and then again once I have a high in the middle of the night.

Finding an Endo,"Am dissatisfied with my PCP and am looking to find an Endo for at least a second opinion or to take over my diabetes care. I prefer not to ask my PCP for a recommendation as I'm sure he'd just refer me to one of the specialists that are part of the same corporation.  That may be where I end up, I'd like to get there because it's the best choice.  I live in a university town with a medical school (Greenville NC) so there are numerous Endos in the area to choose from.  Most of these have a few (<5) reviews on the usual online sites, and no one stands out, and many are ranked 3 out of 5.   What are folks using to assist in making a choice?",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14r86yf/finding_an_endo/,"I got suggestions from people I know. You could also possibly post in a FB group for your city if you don’t know anyone with diabetes in the area? You may also want to call around and see if they require you to be at a certain A1C to take you, that’s the problem I’m having now. My diabetes is too controlled to get in with the endo 😒"

I got a referral from my PCP, and they didn't accept my insurance. So I checked with my insurance to find an endo, and I tried with 3 different offices before I finally got someone to answer, and make an appointment. Then even though the one I found was ""Accepting new patients"" the earliest I could get an appointment was 7 months out, but other of their colleagues had one 3 months out. 

Even if it's from the same group your PCP is in, give them a shot. Just because they're connected, doesn't mean they will parrot what your PCP does. If you don't like them, or what they say, as long as there's a reason and not just ""I don't want to change my diet and lifestyle"", then you can still look around and find someone else. You don't have to stop with a second opinion. Get a third, fourth and fifth if you need.

To help with not needing a 3rd,4th,5th, opinion, whomever you see,  explain your concerns with what your PCP is telling you, give them a chance to address your concerns. 

Also, it might be time to find a new PCP. I had a long relationship with my PCP, but over the years, things changed. The doctor stopped seeing patients and I was seeing Nurse Practitioners, the level of care and attention drifted away as one NP left and new ones came in, wait times increasing to were I'd HAVE to arrive 15 minutes early, wait 45 minutes, and then get 5 minutes with NP and the appointment was over. And I continued this for years when I didn't have insurance. When I got some, and my PCP wasn't in network, I found someone new, and found my quality of care vastly improved. I had let my comfort of going to somewhere I knew and felt safe, overcome my actual needs and wants."

The FB group for Greenville seems mostly for announcing community events I might try that anyway.  I don't know anyone here that's diabetic, it doesn't come up in normal conversation.  Over time I've become less satisfied with my PCP, who I've been seeing since the spring of 2021 when we moved into the area.  At first, it seemed like he was a good one, but over time I've revised my impression -- it's hard to develop an understanding of someone based on 12-minute interactions at 6-month intervals.  He insisted on stopping metformin \~9 months ago, and now my once excellent numbers are all going the wrong way and he's unwilling to do anything.  I could go on and the point that perhaps a different PCP would be the way to go is also under serious consideration."

First, I was diagnosed at only 18 months. Of course it has been challenging to grow up with everything that comes with type 1. But I have had a great childhood and teenage years. I am just about to turn 21 and I am excited for life. All of this to say, it’s going to be ok. Life with type 1 is hard, but still so so good. 
Second, technology is only getting better. Just in my 19 years with type 1 I have seen such drastic improvement. I didn’t get a CGM until eighth grade which was about 13 years after being diagnosed. CGM and looping technology has changed my life. And fortunately everyone getting diagnosed now will never have to live without them. 
This time is scary. Me and my family have been there. But it is going to be ok. I’m living proof."

Has anyone else experienced dramatic early changes?,"Hello, 27F, this is my first time posting here, and I hope I don't break any rules with this post. Let me be clear, I am not looking for specific medical advice with this post. Guidance is appreciated & I am mostly wondering if others are in a similar situation as myself.

This past late February (2023) I went to see my PCP after about 2 years (didn't have any issues so I didn't feel the need to go to the doctor for a while then it was 2 years later, oops). Did a non-fasting glucose test but hadn't eaten for about 6 hours or so when I did it. From that blood test, I received the diagnosis that I am a Type 2 diabetic (Glucose: 241, A1c:11.9). Was immediately put on insulin (14 at first then went down to 10 and this hasn't changed) and 2000mg of metformin.

At first, I was very scared and felt very alone as I (thankfully) have no one in my close family or friends that have dealt with this sort of thing. I try changing my diet but end up falling back into old habits because eating healthy is very expensive, especially avoiding carbs and refined sugars. I also had issues with keeping my blood sugar up at first so I started eating a lot of cookies (fat and sugar combo to maintain). So basically with falling into bad habits again and not really changing the rest of my lifestyle (add 15 minutes of extra walking since it's been warm) the only real difference is the cutting of ice cream (I wasn't eating truckloads to begin with btw) and the metformin. If my blood sugar has been exceptionally low that day I skip my insulin shot at night.

Fast forward 4 months later and I do a fasting blood test (Glucose: 90, A1c: 5.4). Given the small amount of change in my lifestyle this seems like a very dramatic change from HbA1c 11.9 -> 5.4. Has anyone else experienced such dramatic results? Are these results actually not that dramatic and are normal starting out? Does Metformin actually have a stronger effect on some individuals?",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14qxfvb/has_anyone_else_experienced_dramatic_early_changes/,"I too had dramatic results when I was diagnosed. I spent 2 weeks in denial and then consulted with physicians with whom I worked at a medical school. They all told me the same thing, ""Stop eating carbohydrates"". This has worked for me. I keep a close eye on my numbers each day. I eat less than 20 carbs per day, some days are zero. My BG stabilized below 100. My last A1C was 5.0. So, dramatic results are certainly possible. I was also warned not to use insulin or an insulin pusher to treat this disease. Hyperinsulemia causes its own problems and accellerates insulin resistance."
Undiagnosed? - Listen to your body!,"I was a prediabetic, then diabetic, etc., etc. according to my doctor visits over the past 10+ years.  I saw my doctor every 6 months, took Metformin, listened to my doctor tell me how to eat and always replied that I'd do better.  I knew how to eat right as I had lost a lot of weight using Atkins / Keto type diets (and gained it back).  But, I never got back on those diets like I said I would.  Slowly my eating habits got worse and worse.  I still ate smart by some standards, but not smart enough.

My A1C ranged between 5.5 in 2019 to 7.5 in 11/2022.

In the spring of 2023, my body started talking to me.  I had just turned 66 and started to notice my balance wasn't as good as it was, my ankles hurt, my shins above my ankles just felt a little crampy, I felt weak and a little lightheaded.  I started to crave sweets which I normally avoided entirely.  I started having extreme thirst and the associated urination.  Someone left some orange juice in our fridge, so I started diluting it and drinking that as a change from just water.  I hadn't had orange juice in 30 years.  I started to notice my vision was changing.  All of the sudden I didn't need reading glasses?  Shortly after that, my vision changed some more and everything became blurry.  On the plus side, some of my clothes fit better all of the sudden!  I had a day of housework before I flew back to our main home.  I could only get about halfway through a task before I had to sit or lay down.  I was exhausted.  My last few days before flying home were consumed by resting, drinking and peeing.  I don't think I ate anything for 2 days.  I got on the airplane and flew home without any problems.  Once in the airport, my thirst took over again and I had to stop at every drinking fountain on the way out of the airport.  I contacted my doctor and saw him two days later - early May 2023.

While showering to get ready for the doctor appointment I could barely stand in the shower.  I figured this is what a heart attack is - except I had no pain.  I had a hard time holding my arms over my head.  I knocked a bunch of stuff over in the shower and my wife, who had been hovering in the background came rushing in.  My wife wound up driving me to the doctor.  I think I could have driven myself, but it wouldn't have been a good idea I'm sure.  Walking through the parking lot into the office building was a deliberate and careful process for me.

So, in the doctor's office, I tell him I feel like total shit.  He takes blood, checks a few other things and says he'll get back to me.  That night I get a phone call at 11:30 pm.  It's a nurse with the hospital my doctor is affiliated with.  The nurse tells me my blood glucose reading is 541 and the doctor will be in touch in the morning.

My tests start to show up on MyChart and my A1C that had ranged between 5.5 in 2019 to 7.5 in 11/2022 jumped to **16.9 in May 2023!**

I got a phone call from my doctor and he gave me the Cliff Notes on testing and injecting insulin and by early that afternoon I was pricking and sticking.  I went on Tresiba and NovoLOG.  I'm now also on Ozmepic.  In the 2 months that I've been at this, I've injected myself about 250 times.  My sugars are in a great range, my use of NovoLOG is at the minimum level or I get to skip shots and I just moved to 1.0 Ozempic.

The real message I wanted to send with this diatribe is to listen to your body, especially if you're being called prediabetic or diabetic (but not yet on insulin, etc.).  If you start feeling weird or off, you probably are.  That sudden weight loss?  Yeah, that's why they ask if you've had any sudden unexpected weight loss I guess.  Get checked if you can't check your own blood sugar numbers (which is something I totally blew off as a not for me sort of thing).  I hope this helps someone who is reading this thread trying to figure out what's going on with themselves!

If you are diabetic, let me suggest that you get a CGM, it simplifies checking yourself and if you pay attention to it you will quickly learn what your triggers are and be able to make immediate changes.

&#x200B;",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14qn1ys/undiagnosed_listen_to_your_body/,You might try severely limiting your carbohydrate intake. That solved the A1C problem for me. I don't think you can nibble around the edges of your diet with type 2. It takes real change.

Fasting seems relatively okay after eating heavy carbs last evening,"Good morning everyone!
 
I'm trying to understand something. 
I had a very stressful day yesterday and i fell back into comfort food, which was I ate a bunch of carbs.

I think I can't say for sure but if I'm guessing it's 300-350 in one go in the evening around 7 pm and didn't eat much after, just some spearmint tea.

I've been on metformin 500mg once a day for a week now.

The thing is when I woke up today and tested my fasting it was 5.9 mmol/L, which isn't low for sure but it's definitely lowe because  It's usually been 6.4 the last few days when I was eating completely low carb.

The only change is this meal and I had two omega 3 capsules arpund bedtime. In the morning I just had some celery yesterday and a glass of coffee with almond milk as opposed to my usual high fat breakfast.

Before testing in the morning I had two cups of spearmint tea again but that's it.

I'm trying to figure out why my fasting isn't higher,  but glad too.

Could it be that metformin is working?

I used to have a very very shitty diet before I got diagnosed, so is it like the conditions my body is used to maybe?",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14r4ksi/fasting_seems_relatively_okay_after_eating_heavy/,Metformin is unfortunately not a magic pill but the body does vary from time to time. You will notice trends soon enough and adjust your diet to keep them good. You had a lucky pass .

My fasting varies from 4.8-6.2 depending where i am on my menstrual cycle, and if i test immediately upon waking up vs after having gotten up and walked around a bit. Sometimes i have nocturnal hypos which triggers an adrenaline response that spikes glucose. Or i have a weird dream and wake up with rapid heartbeat. But I take a measurement it everyday and it averages out to 5.4 on a monthly basis."

If the next data point we have is 12ish hours later, that’s half a day of processing that your body got to do. If anything, I would take the lower fasting number as evidence of a bunch of insulin response as opposed to some miracle. Your blood sugar may have been in the stratosphere for 6 hours after that and your pancreas may have been working all night trying to catch up.

I’m not trying to lecture you one direction or the other. I just doubt that week of metformin and low carb eating freed up enough metabolic capacity to eat 300g of carbs and not be sky high for hours regardless of what things looked like in the morning."

Additionally I do understand that metformin is not a miracle drug, or compensates for high BG like insulin shots do, but I was wondering whether I'm having a good response to it ie it's making my cells more receptive to insulin that's being produced in my body, especially because I have PCOS and due to it, I suspect I've had insulin resistance for years now."

Because I'm guessing it was probably high after two hours but I forgot to test it since I went to sleep two hours later.

My main question for asking is not specifically to continue with this kind of disordered eating because, but I was asking more to understand if completely cutting out carbs is better for my system or to have some of it daily in restricted amounts, especially complex carbs, because from what I see the elevated levels were more when my diet was completely no carbs, so I'm wondering if suddenly switching to No carbs from eating carbs regularly before has wrecked my system, because the fasting 6.4 mmol/L were on the days when I had zero carbs the previous day, almost a keto diet actually barring maybe very very negligible amount of carbs.

Because I had very disordered eating habits before and having cycles of keto to carb heavy diets is normal for me from years, I'm just trying to see if maybe a consistent eating pattern with balanced carbs is better than completely taking it out."

Yesterday I ate too much spicy food for dinner and i had diarrhea middle of the night. Was dehydrated and my fasting was a bit higher. Made a note in my logbook for my endo. No biggie."
Fasting seems relatively okay after eating heavy carbs last evening,"Good morning everyone!
 
I'm trying to understand something. 
I had a very stressful day yesterday and i fell back into comfort food, which was I ate a bunch of carbs.

I think I can't say for sure but if I'm guessing it's 300-350 in one go in the evening around 7 pm and didn't eat much after, just some spearmint tea.

I've been on metformin 500mg once a day for a week now.

The thing is when I woke up today and tested my fasting it was 5.9 mmol/L, which isn't low for sure but it's definitely lowe because  It's usually been 6.4 the last few days when I was eating completely low carb.

The only change is this meal and I had two omega 3 capsules arpund bedtime. In the morning I just had some celery yesterday and a glass of coffee with almond milk as opposed to my usual high fat breakfast.

Before testing in the morning I had two cups of spearmint tea again but that's it.

I'm trying to figure out why my fasting isn't higher,  but glad too.

Could it be that metformin is working?

I used to have a very very shitty diet before I got diagnosed, so is it like the conditions my body is used to maybe?",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14r4ksi/fasting_seems_relatively_okay_after_eating_heavy/,"Consistency should lead to predictability for your body. If you go low carb (call it 100g or less) without going all the way to keto, my understanding is that your body will adjust accordingly over time. It will release enough insulin for the expected amount of carbs. Less carbs and less volatility in your glucose levels. Keto and 300g binges are the extremes, so sticking to something in the middle that is manageable might avoid the binges while still helping with the rest of your goals.

I’ve read that your fasting level average is one of the last things that changes. So weeks/months/years of good control are what really indicates progress with your fasting level. I wouldn’t read too far into this isolated situation. It might be right back to normal tomorrow."
Thoughts? Honestly I don't know if I would trust it.,,https://i.redd.it/e8kcpz9zfz9b1.png,"This is their 3rd generation, so it probably improved since the 1st generation that I tried out.

It does what it says, monitors interstitial fluid to determine glucose and send the number to your phone.  The implantation is minor surgery on your shoulder, and you get to remove the transmitter daily for naked showers while the transmitter charges.  I liked the transmitter on my arm as it would buzz me to check my phone for highs and lows.  It was a silent alarm.

I believe (from the surveys they have sent me recently) that the transmitter use is optional now.  You can scan the sensor with your phone to get a reading instead of having something glued to your shoulder all the time.

Being 180 day sensor, you only have 3-4 surgeries a year.  1 implant sensor (first time use), then 2 to remove that sensor, then 3 to implant a new sensor on the opposite shoulder.  4 is if you had on from the previous year to remove.

These were surprisingly resilient to the heat and sun of Arizona.  I had no issues with it while walking in 105F full sun with a t-shirt covering the sensor.

Now I used the 1st generation, so there were issues:

* Finding a surgeon to do it was hard (easier now)
* The readings were always 40+ points different than my meter in a random direction, which is a unit of insulin impact.  So I couldn't use it to make injection decisions.  (probably improved, but I don't know).
* The sensor requires 2 calibrations daily.  Their surveys seem to indicate this is still required, but I don't know for sure.  The app in the 1st generation did not remind you of the calibrations and the sensor would stop working in the middle of the night/day depending on which calibration was missed.  I hope they fixed this.

It has an app, and shows trends and can produce reports for your doctor."
Thoughts? Honestly I don't know if I would trust it.,,https://i.redd.it/e8kcpz9zfz9b1.png,"It seems more difficult to get insurers to cover the Eversense — than it is about the device being a problem. Some have said light affected readings, and some have said the removal was a little more difficult than expected sometimes. But general reports are that it’s readings are inline with other CGM like Dexcom.

Dexcom G7 and Libre are one piece sensors and transmitters now. Dexcom G6 was separate transmitter and sensor. The Dexcom
and Libre have to be replaced every 10 or 14 days. 

Eversense sensor needs to be removed and reinserted about every 6 months, which is better than the previous 3 months. So, a “minor” surgical procedure, whereas Dexcom and Libre are do it yourself. Eversense has a separate transmitter that you put overtop of where the subcutaneous sensor is. And they claim it lasts for a year.  

A big difference might be that Eversense has to be surgically removed to get an MRI scan done, whereas Dexcom and Libre also need to be removed, but are much easier to pull off as needed, obviously.

Eversense is supposed to be calibrated twice daily, Dexcom calibration is optional as needed, and I’m not sure about Libre but they claim it doesn’t need calibration."

The surgery will leave more and more scarred tissue until eventually you won't be able to use the arm anymore for proper readings. There've been various reports of the sensors failing early too (may have improved with further development), plus you need fingersticks anyways to calibrate, and you run without values while the transmitter charges.

My endo flat out refused to prescribe it for the reasons above, and I agree."

Fibre in grains, fruits, and vegetables help to soften the curve of the glucose spike, so if you find yourself wanting fruit or bready things, aim for the fruit rather than juice, or wholemeal rather than white bread. 

A lot of people struggle with being super restrictive in what they eat so having a plan B of ""if I eat bread, it's brown wholemeal"" or ""instead of orange juice, I'll have an orange"" might be useful.

Most people are unwilling. I was only willing to change because I knew my wife could not function in this world without me, (she is mildy autistic) and I had doctors where I worked on my case until I complied. They would just tell me to sit down while I was working and they would take a blood sample. They were not happy with me until my diet excluded carbohydrates. So you see, I had a lot of incentive to change. These doctors were my bosses and they ordered me to stop eating carbohydrates. If I did eat any, it would show up on the blood test they kept taking from me and I would be warned. These were physicians doing research work and my job would be in jeopardy if I refused to obey them. I did electronic and software design to enable their research. At first I was resentful of their hard core orders. In time, I realize they were looking out for my best interests and their own.

They needed constant changes to their software to keep up their research and knew it would be difficult to replace me."

But that's probably good food advice across the board for humans. The more easily accessible the food's components are, the more it should slot into 'occasional' or 'seldom' items in one's diet. Most of us live a pretty labour-light physical existence so the quick-acting carbs don't get utilised in the same way they would if we were under more constant physical exertion.

That and ultra-processed foods (think things that come primarily in packages in the middle of the store) are engineered for cravability. ""Once you pop, you can't stop"" wasn't a tagline, it was a threat.

Edit: Re: ""the quick-acting carbs don't get utilised in the same way""... This is assuming all things are equal. If you're having a hypo, have the sugar or glucose shot, obviously. I'm referring to general day to day metabolic processing."

I'm all for moderation, but it's a lot easier to go ""I'm out and about, I'm going to have two donut holes and a cup of coffee"" and be able to stop at two than buy a six pack of donuts and spread them out over a week (or whatever it is before they go stale).

You will need to know what foods are causing your BG to rise. I was diagnosed 20 years ago. I am doing fine. It is not a death sentence unless we ignore our BG levels or go into denial. I went into total denial for 2 weeks after I was diagnosed. A short time maybe but it sure made me understdand how easily one can get into denial.

I have a BG meter and use it regularly. I need to know where my BG happens to be at that instant and what spikes some foods might give me. 

I have been keeping my carb intake down to below 20 per day. Some days are zero. In the last 20 years my diabetes has not progressed or caused complications. My last A1C was 5.0. I chose to try to stay as healthy as possible even with the T2 diagnosis.

You are on the righ track. Keep in mind that any reading over 140 causes irreversible cellular damage. Most people who are diagnosed with type 2 are willing to accept this damage after a meal that includes carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are damn addicting. I know.....

You have the ability to stop any progression or complilcations. It is up to you. It was an easy decision for me.

Make sure you calibrate on the the Dexcom app AND the Tandem itself [Options] -> [My GCM] -> [Calibrate CGM]. It may take a few days, but it worked for me. It may also just be the sensor itself.

I spike to 200-250 when i do HIIT but it recovers within 1h afterwards. I am usually peaking at zone 4-5 cardio when i do these workouts.

https://www.healthline.com/diabetesmine/why-does-exercise-sometimes-raise-your-blood-sugar#Release-of-glucose-raising-hormones

Aerobic exercise is tough for blood sugar management.  My wife has to keep her heart rate in zone 3 or lower to avoid the blood sugar swings. This means longer but low intensity exercise is best for her.  Once you cross into anaerobic or “lactic acid” zones you will start using glucose instead of fat stores which causes the initial dip and then the liver will release glucose spiking you up after.   

Another super annoying thing about being a type 1."

If US, Walmart.

If UK, find a 24 hour pharmacy, go in  and buy some test strips. I was in the same situation as you are now, the monitor cost me about £16 and the bottle of test strips cost me about £20. 

Be sure the monitor matches the test strips (GlucoRX HCT, which is the monitor handed out in Kent, doesn’t take the GlucoRX Nexus test strips which are given out in Essex.. make sure they match.)

Boots has AccuCheck, I’m on the website right now. I realise it ain’t much help given it’s 9:30 pm in the UK, but I’m sure there will be a late night pharmacy open somewhere close by even if you have to drive/get someone to drive you there/taxi."

Obviously you should have diabetic supplies set up on repeat prescription, but it’s always a good idea to have backup options for just in case measures. You shouldn’t have to buy them, and they might not have offered it if they had a different monitor in stock.

I called I think six pharmacies before one told me that they didn’t have the strips I was looking for but they had other monitors and other stripsbut apparently that didn’t occur to the previous pharmacies I’d called. 

Is it expensive having to blow the money when we get supplies on the NHS? Yes. But having them is more important."

It gets easier and easier to maintain as time goes on and you see the results from putting in the work. Also I find that meals are very satisfying and I’m full so I don’t crave carbs as I have in the past. There are still times where I have “unexplained highs” but they are far less outside the norm than in the past, a high now may be a weird spike to 160 rather than 200+. On the other side as I’m taking 1/2 of the insulin I used to have to take the lows are more controllable because they come on more gradually with less total insulin on board. After a while of being very strict, I started to incorporate cheat items into a couple of random meals throughout the week. With some trial and error I’ve become better at predicting the needed insulin for those items. I’d say try it and decide for yourself, it worked for me."

If your goal is very tight control, and better glucose is a direct motivator, then a lower carb method would likely show good results. There isn’t one “keto diet” as they vary somewhat between personalities and sources of info. “Keto” is generally high in fats, very low in carbs (20g/day), and low in protein (20ish% of food).  

Dr Bernstein (as mentioned elsewhere in this thread) is not “keto.” His methodology is higher protein, low carb (30g/day), and he is not afraid of naturally occurring fats nor is he afraid of ketosis and ketones, so long as blood glucose stays normalized and proper medication is used (also includes exercise in his method). 

As alluded to, he is an advocate for the Law of Small Numbers: Less carbs requires less insulin, so less highs, and less mistakes in dosing that lead to lows. But he is not considered “keto” as he thinks people on high fat methodology don’t fare as well long term, since protein is necessary for controllable gluconeogenesis and for building blocks, especially to maintain muscle mass. Some “keto” advocates warn against too much protein, as they fear gluconeogenesis would knock them out of ketosis. 

Good luck finding a suitable method. a"

My 80 yo father,"My 80 yo father was diagnosed Type 2 a year ago and only recently started taking it seriously after a scare a few weeks ago. 

Is there a good source or YT channel that can explain what needs to change in his life?",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14qlm7g/my_80_yo_father/,"There’s many resources on Youtube and the web, many books and podcasts for support. 

But at 80, it depends more of what he is capable of doing. 80-something’s vary in their abilities to manage and change their ways. I have one who drives and takes care of her own house and bills and coordinates all her doctors appointments. And I have another who is insulin dependent diabetic who refuses to change her sugar-heavy diet in any way, and totally needs helps with all aspects of her care, though she thinks otherwise.

Did the doctor prescribe any medications? And if so, can he reliably take the meds as needed?

Is he able to get any physical activity? Moving muscles helps to soak up excess glucose, but joints and balance, mobility issues are going to be different for him than someone who is significantly younger.   

Would he be willing to eat differently? For example, cutting back on simple sugars and highly processed starches will help greatly. Does he prepare his own food or does someone else do it for him? Would want to eat more like farm and garden food, rather than junky factory food like chips and cookies and bread. 

Also, healthcare might be more lax with glucose range goals for someone who is 80+, compared to someone who is younger. One fear is that they could overmedicate with insulin or sulfonylurea and suffer a low glucose, and have problems associated with that kind of incident. Some meds like metformin might also cause some belly upset for a while, so bathroom proximity might be necessary till a person’s system gets used to the med. An older person’s glucose needs are not dramatically different than a younger person’s but doctors may be cautious about trying to get A1C down toward 5% or even 6% and may suggest higher target is okay.

Are you doing the learning or is your father wanting to know directly? What kind of info are you looking for? Is he living with caretakers or by himself?

There are also Certified Diabetes Educators who can give more face to face and personalized suggestions. An appointment probably wouldn’t be too hard to set up.

Oh, and we test our own glucose levels at home to monitor and make decisions, so maybe he is or isn’t able to do that? A glucometer would need to be easy enough to use and big enough to read for his old eyes. There are more high tech (and expensive) CGMs like Libre or Dexcom, which can offer remote monitoring by family members, if that is what he would want. But he’d need a smartphone and to have some basic tech capabilities."

Is there a good source or YT channel that can explain what needs to change in his life?",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14qlm7g/my_80_yo_father/,"Okay, metformin has some unpleasant starting effects, but is generally OK and recommended for starting with insulin resistance. 

It reduces the release of glucose from the liver storage, and also somewhat sensitizes cells to the presence of insulin, and also stimulates glucose receptors in muscle cells. It is usually taken once or twice per day. One explanation for the diarrhea that some experience is that metformin also reduces absorption of glucose and the glucose in the stool has an osmotic/water attracting effect. Other than needing a toilet, it is uncommon to have low blood glucose from metformin alone. Some people have difficulty absorbing B12 while on it, and a rare side effect is lactic acidosis. 

There are lots of meds, but metformin is probably the least dangerous. If the gut problems persist there is an extended release version that some people prefer.

CGMs measure interstitial fluid which can be 10-20 mins behind fingerstick readings. Great for monitoring trends but not always great when you are trying to correct a high/low, or when the glucose levels are rapidly changing. 

I've also heard that CGMs tend to read lower than blood glucose monitors. But all of mine were reading higher, so it's important to still do a daily blood glucose fingerstick reading just to make sure you know how ""off"" the sensor is. 

I use Skin Tac wipes to help the sensors adhere better. And I also put on a Skin Grip overpatch so the sensor doesn't snag on things and get ripped off."

A note about placement.. I only put it on my right arm, usually taking a few days off in between the end of one and the beginning of a new one. I also have MS and some numbness on my right side so I can't lay on that side, nor on my back. Because some of the numbness goes down the back of my right arm, I don't put the CGM on the back side because it's so crazy irritating. It does well on the front/slightly towards the outside of the bicep. I think the readings come through just a little bit better from the tissue here rather than on the underside / tricep area, on me.

There's a sort of paper tape ring that comes with it, which is sufficient if you choose not to buy any of the covers or surrounds that you can get. You definitely want to make sure you put it on smoothly or have someone help you. One time I put it on and there was a pretty major wrinkle.

The only one I haven't tried is the Medtronic.  

The Dexcom is the most reliable and easiest to use IMO.  The g7 is a solid improvement over the g6 for most things.  Definitely smaller and much easier to put on, even if you use the included overpatch.  I had my first crappy Dexcom sensor last month, ridiculously wrong readings, but that's the first time in dozens of sensors.  And they sent me a replacement no questions asked.

I hated having to scan the Libre manually,  that felt ridiculous after my Dexcom.  But the Libre is quite a bit cheaper if that matters to you.  I haven't used the new Libre 3 yet, but it looks promising.  Eventually they will get that out to a once a month sensor if the rumor mill is accurate.  Still feel like their app is clunky and the process is a bigger pain than Dexcom but wouldn't hesitate to use it if the price difference was substantial.

The Eversense is interesting in a lot of ways, and I liked it for a lot of things, but the constant calibration requirements and charging the transmitter every day was a pain in the neck.  Not having any insertions to mess with for 6 months was nice, but having the implant put in and removed is an outpatient treatment, and I'm not in love with that process at all.  I hated the daily sticker change and transmitter placement too ... it wasn't hard, just an extra hassle.  I'm not a morning person,  and it was just one too many things for me.  It was accurate and reliable once it was calibrated though.  And they do have a heck of a rebate program that makes it about $150 for the first 6 months, so there was that.  

Overall,  I recommend the Dexcom.  You can't beat the features, accuracy, and reliability.  If it's going to be the same copay for you, that's the one to ask for."

-Its about the size of a quarter and has no bulk. Extremely discreet. 

-It has a very short lag between the reading and your actual blood sugar. Sometimes I would test my blood and it would be within 5 points of what the sensor said

-Its all one piece. There is no separate transmitter like Dexcom g6. The packaging is very compact which makes it easier to travel with.

-It lasts 14 days

-It looks cute

Cons of Libre 3:

-The sensor reads every minute, which sounds nice but it actually isn't necessary and makes your phone battery drain almost twice as fast. 

-You can't calibrate it. If the readings are wrong you just have to wait it out. I've had to take a sensor out because it wasnt accurate and there was no way to fix it.

-It had connection and signal errors so often, sometimes a couple times a day. Very frustrating.

Pros of Dexcom:

-You can calibrate the sensor(manually enter your blood sugar number into the app) to help get more accuracy if you are seeing incorrect numbers

-The app is excellent. It comes with a data analysis app called Clarity that makes great graphs with your glucose data. It is a very useful tool in determining how to better your management

- It reads every 5 minutes, making it much less taxing ok your phone battery. 

Cons of Dexcom:

-It is a bigger unit, both in packaging and in the physical piece. Its over an inch in length and about half an inch in height.

- The sensor and transmiter are separate peices. Sensor is changed every 10 days and the transmitter ended every 90 days. (This is also kind of a plus because you can hack your dex to give you another 10 days by popping out the transmitter) 

-The reading is 15 minutes behind your current blood sugar

I just recently switched back to dexcom because of how badly libre3 was draining my phone battery and my inability to calibrate it."

I chose G7 and  have used it for 4 months. 

L3 is a little smaller and it's round and does not require an over-patch. G7 is slightly larger, slightly eccentric oval, and requires an over patch which is supplied, but the supplied ones are round so they don't like fit and they're hard to apply. I use ones designed for G7 from Amazon. They are cheap and they work fine.

I chose G7 over L3 because of the 12th hour window for replacing. The L3 literally counts down to the exact second on which you have to replace it. Asinine programming.

I've had three G7 sensors fail in the course of 4 months. They have been replaced by dexcom. 

The apps are very similar. I prefer the L3 apps ability to review blood sugar curves over the last 14 days. You can get the same with dexcom clarity on a desktop computer. Clarity on the phone sucks. It generates a PDF for you to review. 20 years out of date technology.

Most interesting thing you will discover from a CGM is how many times you would have had to pick your finger to get the same view of what is going on. How many times did you pick your finger at 3am?

You will find interesting correlations. Yes carbs are what makes your blood sugar Spike but you can mix carbs with fat and protein and avoid the spikes at least to an extent.

The hardest question with the CGM is what exactly you're trying to achieve in terms of blood glucose pattern. You now have a speedometer but what exactly are the speed limits. What are the safe driving speeds?

Also I found the Glance clockface for the Fitbit watch which shows your blood glucose and recent history on the watch face."

What's the appropriate/correct time to measure fasting glucose? Do fasting glucose and morning glucose (dawn phenomenon) are two different things?,"Hi,

I was recently diagnosed with diabetes. My A1C is 7.1, and I started walking in the morning to control my weight.
I check my blood glucose 4 times a day, and here are my usual readings.

Wake-up (fasted): 125 to 140.
1 hour after meal: 140 to 180
2 hours after meal: 130 to 158 (mostly under 140).
3 or later hours usually: 89 to 125.

Now I was wondering what's going on with me since my post meal levels are not bad or pretty much within the range.

Is this something called dawn phenomenon?

What time after dinner I should check my fasting blood glucose? Is it 8 hours after dinner or as soon as I wake up?

Note: I ate at midnight last night that's around 12 am. I ate some veggies and a guava. Wokeup in the morning and check my blood glucose around 5:20 am, and it was 140.

What's the appropriate/correct time to measure fasting glucose? Do fasting glucose and morning glucose (dawn phenomenon) are two different things?,"Hi,

I was recently diagnosed with diabetes. My A1C is 7.1, and I started walking in the morning to control my weight.
I check my blood glucose 4 times a day, and here are my usual readings.

Wake-up (fasted): 125 to 140.
1 hour after meal: 140 to 180
2 hours after meal: 130 to 158 (mostly under 140).
3 or later hours usually: 89 to 125.

Now I was wondering what's going on with me since my post meal levels are not bad or pretty much within the range.

Is this something called dawn phenomenon?

Most of us sleep for 7-8 hours and didn't eat for a few hours before sleep, so the morning glucose is the fasting glucose.

So if you had waited to check after 8:00 a.m. then you would have gotten a fasting number.

Your 140 may be a combination of guava at midnight, and dawn phenomenon, but you would have to have several fasting tests in the morning to see what the number typically is without the midnight guava to see if that is happening.

Post-prandial (after a meal) numbers are usually checked 2 hours after the meal was completed."

Some diabetics experience it more than others. But essentially it's when your blood sugar rises on its own without any food in the morning shortly after walking up.

Basically you've been sleeping through the night so your body goes on auto pilot by keeping the vital systems running like keeping you breathing while you sleep etc etc. However, when you wake up your body has to get the other systems (like the muscular system which yes we do move a bit while we sleep but not near as much when we're awake) out of sleep mode for the new day and sometimes this process of waking up can cause your sugars to go up a bit."

Upping the dosage might be an option for you as well since you're not really near the 'limit'; maybe your doctor would up your dosage if changing the timing doesn't work.

Is this a result of ketosis?",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14pvred/had_control_lost_it_i_dont_get_it/,"OP, I’ve lived life as both T2 (misdiagnosed) and T1.5 LADA (so now insulin dependent) so I’ve had plenty of experience with DKA.

A few points about safety. First, if you are used to running high it is possible to experience low blood sugar symptoms while you’re in a normal range.

It’s entirely possible maintaining better control has you feeling sweaty, dizzy, low energy, vaguely nauseated, etc. 

Those symptoms will even out and get better over time. Just takes some getting used to.

Second, and most importantly: the remedy to DKA is not more carbs and higher sugar. That makes DKA **worse.**

The correct treatment for DKA is fluids and insulin. You need fluids to flush ketones and small doses of insulin over time along with minimal calories to keep from going too low.

Third: **Ketosis is NOT diabetic ketoacidosis.** 

They are two different systems in the body. There’s a lot of misinformation out there and even some medical professionals get it wrong.

You absolutely should be tested to make sure your diabetes is not autoimmune. That said, if you are a T2, it is unlikely (but not impossible) that you are experiencing DKA.

If you still have pancreatic function your body will release insulin to keep you out of DKA. Ketones in your urine can be due to weight loss or a ketogenic diet. 

They don’t necessarily mean that you’re in DKA. As I said, if you’re T2 it’s unlikely to occur.

Warning signs: if you experience any of the following symptoms please head immediately to the ER. Sugars remaining over 300 mg/dl coupled with ketones in your urine; nausea or vomiting; brain fog/inability to think clearly; difficulty breathing or inability to take a deep breath; breath that smells fruity and/or sweat that smells of acetone.

Those are all indications of DKA and you need insulin. Don’t wait. You could lose consciousness.

I was finally correctly diagnosed after a bad episode of DKA. I put off calling 911 because my mother was fighting cancer and I didn’t want to alarm her.

I remember getting wheeled into the ambulance (sorta) but by the time we got to the hospital six miles away I was in a coma. Almost didn’t make it tbh.

Diabetes of any kind has a steep learning curve. People in the various diabetes subs are well-informed and supportive. We’re here for you.

Ask anything and if there’s an issue with your diabetes education or care speak up. We’ve all been through the early days and most people here are generous with their time and happy to help.

Please take care. 💙"

A lot of people feel like shit for a few days after going below low carb and into full keto.

The meal probably pulled you out of ketosis. Maybe the wacky glucose levels were an overreaction to the ketosis break. I have read that cooking carrots frees up more carbs because the complex starches break down.

Did you come back down from that 190? Even if your baseline moved a little, if you are back in the same ballpark after a few hours, you’re probably ok.

Similar position as you for starting. Diagnosed end of April at 10.1. Low carb immediately and down to 100 average or so. Fasting is anywhere from 95 to 115. It went down a lot a few weeks ago and then crept back up and now it’s trending down again."

Was put on 1000 mg of metformin to start, they tried to push it to 2000 initially, but I had bouts of nausea and we settled on 1500. For the first few weeks of 1500 my numbers were fantastic, I had an average of 100 mg/dl sugar reading. Slowly though it seemed like my fasting levels slowly rose. I tried to over compensate by eating less carbs. It all came to a head on Saturday. I went to take a shower and felt incredibly sluggish, just zero energy. On a whim I took an at home ketone test and found 'moderate' ketone levels in my blood. I hadn't intended to go into ketosis, and was worried maybe I was DKA or something because of how bad I felt. I had a sandwich on whole wheat and then a salad and finally a piece of pita. Yes, bad, but I was very scared about my health. I slowly felt better but my sugar numbers were being weird. I spiked but stayed under 180 which I found odd. Sunday I ate better, my numbers spiked high but stayed in range. Today I started the day late after calling into work because I still feel a little fuzzy. I had a plate of cooked carrots, steak and raw cucumber, and my numbers spiked crazy high, all the way to 190, which makes zero sense. My dexcom says my 3 day average is at 120 and climbing.

If someone's that sensitive they're likely to be on more than just metformin.

OP, I'd get tested to make sure it's not autoimmune and you weren't just diagnosed in the honeymoon phase of LADA. Or, you might be someone strict low carb doesn't work for. Try adjusting your diet to have enough carbs to keep you out of ketosis--it doesn't need to be a ton."

Going from Novolin (1980s insulin that's OTC at Walmart - didn't have insurance for about 6 months) to Humalog last week was a game changer. A friend started giving me boxes of Lantus to use as long acting - they're unopened, he's overprescribed, they're not expired, and my insurance doesn't cover Lantus; that's made a huge difference as well. I'm trying to figure out somewhere local he can donate his excess Lantus to (besides me.. and I know it's expensive - there's a lot of people out there who need it, but don't have the money).

Surprising how many doctors have no clue you can buy insulin at Walmart without an RX, it's just the really old school stuff - box of 5 pens is less than $50. I had one dr argue that there's no way you can buy insulin over the counter no matter what. I opened my Walmart app and showed her a receipt for it, suggested she google ""walmart novolin"". Can't do it in every state, but you can in most. I was just walking up to the pharmacy counter every 2 weeks and asking for a box of Novolin R (regular - the old school ""short acting"") pens, every 4 weeks for Novolin N (the intermediate NPH)"

Struggling to lose weight. Need help,"I (23 F) am  a LADA diabetic diagnosed last May 2023 trying to lose weight. I have been on insulin since diagnosis. I currently weigh 135 lbs with a height of 5 foot 2 inches. 

I've been eating less carbs and more proteins and veggies  and I do 30 min HIIT indoor cycling 3-5x a week for 2 months now since my diagnosis but my weight still stays the same. 

Is there any tips you can share in terms of diet and exercise???",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14qchq2/struggling_to_lose_weight_need_help/,"Oof, 5'1"" lady at 145 so I feel your pain. Down from 220 over 14 months.

The sad reality is it'll take forever.... that's always true when you're close to your ideal weight and even more so when you're as short as us. When it's recommended that you don't eat less than 1200 cal a day, and your body spends around 1400-1600 to stay alive, every extra calorie you eat matters. One of my favorite snacks is cheese cubes with pepperoni, but I usually eat a 150-200 calorie portion. Eat two extra portions in addition to my normal 1200 cal day and bam, calorie deficit gone... 

What I've learned is that the only way to fail at weight loss is to stop trying."

"High blood sugars after eating, even after taking NovoRapid and waiting for 20 mins.","Hello everyone, it’s my first time here in this subreddit. I take novorapid and wait 20-15 mins before eating food. Few minutes after, my blood sugar shoots really high, like 200+ or even 240+. I usually eat the same food most of the time, or something else. I have only started to notice this for the past few days. Otherwise, I would eat the same food and the sugar used to be perfect. I used to do exercise and go to play football, but after a leg injury which has lasted for about a week, I can’t do an forms of physical activity. I have changed more than 4 novorapid pens due to this, but still the same results. The pens were of different batches. I am not sure if am storing the pen incorrectly, since I notice a lot of fog in the glass of the insulin pen. But when I wipe the glass, it becomes clear again. I find this very odd.   But another thing I find weird is that even when I don’t do exercise, I eat the same food and the sugars are good. But today, when I ate exactly the same thing, my blood sugar shot to 291 mg/dl. I take tresiba aswell, but that works fine. It’s only the novorapid creating issues for me. The novorapid and tresiba pens are both always stored in the same fridge at the same temperature. I am hopeless right now and I don’t know what to do. My blood sugars always spike. Even when I increase my insulin dosage, the sugar still shoots to crazy numbers. I use a FreeStyle Libre 2 CGM. I know the readings are not inaccurate since I can feel the symptoms of the high blood sugar within me. Previously, like I said, when I ate food the sugars were good and sometimes it even went low. I used to wait for just 10 minutes and the sugars still went down. I don’t modify the dose or anything. I was able to eat something more too without worrying about it spiking. So now, when I take the exact same dose I usually use to take, the sugar spikes A LOT. And just like I said, even if I increase the doses, still high blood sugars. I am a type 1 diabetic, so I am wondering if I have become resistant to novorapid or I am doing something wrong. I take insulin on the stomach. I wonder if the high blood sugars are caused by lipohypertrophy, but I don’t notice any bumps or other things on my stomach.

Sorry for my bad English.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14q7jcf/high_blood_sugars_after_eating_even_after_taking/,"Thank you for your reply. Another thing I find weird is that when I take insulin (novorapid) it acts after 10-20 minutes and reduces blood sugars by around 20 mg/dl. After that, I eat the food. Then, the sugar suddenly spikes with my CGM telling me that the blood sugars are rising quickly. Eventually, the blood sugar crosses 180 mg/dl. I’ve tried different pens but still same problem. I really wonder if this is lipohypertrophy since I used to inject on my arms when I first had diabetes but later noticed that my blood sugar management got worse over time when I continuously took insulin on both my arms. I was still on novorapid at that time. After that, I decided to take insulin on my stomach and my blood sugars were more predictable and manageable. Now I split the stomach into 4 zones to take insulin. For breakfast, one zone. For lunch, another zone and for dinner, another zone. This whole month, I noticed my novorapid was delayed and blood sugars rised. But the blood sugars eventually came down. (i don’t know if tresiba was effected since it is long acting). For the past 3-5 days I take insulin and wait for some time before eating food. Now it shoots to a crazy amount (240 mg/dl+) and I have to take insulin again to bring it down, but one thing which makes me wonder if this is lipohypertrophy is the delayed novorapid which takes a lot of time to act. Sometimes it just stops midway, like it just brings down the sugar by 30 mg/dl and then drops a little bit again after some time. If I take insulin and then a hot bath, the sugars go down quickly and I can eat my food without the sugars usually spiking. If this is lipohypertrophy, what can I do to tackle this? All my insulin spots have slow insulin absorption now! My leg is slow to absorb insulin, my arm is slow to absorb insulin and now even my stomach too even though the insulin is usually absorbed fast there. I am getting scared, I don’t want to do a surgery to remove the bumps. Where can I inject the insulin? Sorry for the long text again"
"High blood sugars after eating, even after taking NovoRapid and waiting for 20 mins.","Hello everyone, it’s my first time here in this subreddit. I take novorapid and wait 20-15 mins before eating food. Few minutes after, my blood sugar shoots really high, like 200+ or even 240+. I usually eat the same food most of the time, or something else. I have only started to notice this for the past few days. Otherwise, I would eat the same food and the sugar used to be perfect. I used to do exercise and go to play football, but after a leg injury which has lasted for about a week, I can’t do an forms of physical activity. I have changed more than 4 novorapid pens due to this, but still the same results. The pens were of different batches. I am not sure if am storing the pen incorrectly, since I notice a lot of fog in the glass of the insulin pen. But when I wipe the glass, it becomes clear again. I find this very odd.   But another thing I find weird is that even when I don’t do exercise, I eat the same food and the sugars are good. But today, when I ate exactly the same thing, my blood sugar shot to 291 mg/dl. I take tresiba aswell, but that works fine. It’s only the novorapid creating issues for me. The novorapid and tresiba pens are both always stored in the same fridge at the same temperature.

Removing exercise from the daily routine can increase glucose levels.  Injuries can also increase glucose levels.  So can worrying.  If you are reducing your water intake due to the reduced activity, that can also increase glucose levels.

Check the CGM with a blood glucose meter to verify the sensor is still good.  Assuming it is, then there may need to be additional actions needed.

It is unlikely the pens are at fault, unless they all got hot for a long time, recently.  

Your delay between the shot and food is good.  

It is possible that you are at the end of the honeymoon phase, and your pancreas is producing less insulin now than a month ago.  You may need more basal (Tresiba) if you are seeing rises between meals (maybe not as you say pre-meal numbers are good or low) or you may need more Novorapid to cover the carbohydrates in your food as the carb to insulin ratio may have changed.  

Another thing to consider is changes in the food.  If you were eating brand X of food and now you have to eat brand Y, the carbohydrates may be different between the foods.   If brand X was 40 carbohydrates and brand Y is 60 carbohydrates, then the insulin is not enough to cover brand Y.

Using the same amount of insulin and eating the same food is a way to control diabetes, but bodies and food changes, so there may be a need to change the amount of insulin needed.

Most of us learn how many carbs 1 unit of insulin covers (keeps us near the starting value 2 hours after consuming those carbs) and use that ratio to eat a more varied diet and take the insulin needed for that diet."

You can use AAPS on open loop without Nightscout, but you do need it for close loop. I would recommend ns.10.be.de if you can spend $4-5/month. It makes your life easier than trying to set it up and maintain it yourself. That being said, you can do it for free. It just needs a bit of time. I'm thinking of setting up my free server once I have more time.

I'd say it takes about a month to complete all the objectives. I'm in objective 7 out of 10.

I'd believe you should have your ratios calculated before stating. In general:

I:C ratio = 500/Total Daily Dose (TDD)
ISF = 1650/TDD

Once you have estimates, you need to test them.

To test the I:C ratio, make sure your glucose is leveled for a few hours prior to the test and between 70 - 140. You need to eat something with 30-60 grams of carbs and less than 20 grams of fat. Bolus based on your estimated I:C ratio. Your glucose should rise between 30-50 mg/dL (1.65 - 2.75 mmol/L). If it rises more than that, then you need a lower I:C ratio (e.g., if your estimated I:C is 10 and you went up 70 mg/dL then go to an I:C of 9 and try again). If it rises less, then go up on your I:C ratio.

To test the ISF, you can take one or two glucose tabs to raise your glucose to 140-160, and then inject one unit and see how much it drops you. You have to wait like one or two hours to see the full effect.

Hope it helps"

Thanks for any suggestions",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14pgxvh/breakfast_ideas/,"Just so we can help better, why the minimal fat requirement? Everything else makes sense but generally speaking, fat replaces carbs in low carb for energy. Low carb and low fat is low energy and low satiety which means you’ll have the munchies more often and may crave stuff like carbs that will mess with your glucose control.

Even if eggs aren’t ideal, egg whites are pretty much just protein.

Personally I’d skip the toast every day. Bread is a major spiker for most.

What you may be having overnight is called the dawn effect. Basically the liver starts dumping glucose in the early morning to prepare for waking up. Very normal and just a symptom of the larger metabolic problem that is the beetus.

Why would skipping breakfast screw up your numbers? Not eating is one of our best tools as a type 2."

It's around 300 kcal. 26g carb, 12.6g fat, 18.3g protein, with 3 slices of Kirkland pre-cooked bacon. You could switch the bacon for something leaner or healthier, or have a little more egg white - I tend to use 40-45g which makes for a thin fast-cooking omelette."

Pen tips are quite expensive at my pharmacy ($50 for a box of 100!), but they are cheap on Amazon.

Freestyle Libre (the older version that you have to scan) is $100 per sensor, so $200/month without insurance.

I think most insurance plans cover at least part of the cost - personally, I'm on disability so most of my stuff is covered one way or another. Getting CGMs covered is a pain, but Libre has a special income-based program that your doctor can help you apply for if they aren't covered for you."

Very glad you went to the dcotor.

I think you get it but just in case, his T1 will be very different from the gestational diabetes or T2 that most adults connect to ""diabetes"". 

The first weeks are hard, so hang on, the first year is steep with learning, but after that it gets much better.

I would called your gestational diabetes, ""thing a"" and his type 1 diabetes ""totally different thing 2""

You did good, he avoided a hospital visit and DKA most likely."

I was 33 and all but passed out standing up at Christmas after my father passed away. My stepbrother asked me how many beers I had that day. To which I replied 0. Then 2 days later I could not stop going to the bathroom and drinking water like it was going out of style. I talked to my girlfriend at the the time and she said to go to the doctor. Most of my life I did not go to the doctors so I had no family doctor since I was 16. Luckily the year before I had a sinus infection I could not get rid of so I found my family practice at that point so I made the appointment. I went into the doctors office and described my symptoms and my doctor immediately asked if she could prick my finger and i said yes. I did not register so she asked if I could urinate to r which I replied yes please. The came back and spoke with the doctor. The doctor relayed to me you did not register on the finger stick and you did not register on the urinalysis. To that I replied I do not know what that means. She then stated this the finger stick stops at 600 in blood and the urinalysis stops at 2000. My reply is ok what does that mean. Her reply blood 120 / urine less then 400. She then told me you are going to the hospital call your girlfriend to come get you. Go home get a bag packed and do not waste time and I’m calling ahead for you. My reply I will walk home get my clothes and go to the hospital when she gets off work. Her reply was you have three ways of leaving here, 1 with your girlfriend as soon as she gets here, 2 in an ambulance in 10 mins, 3 in the back of a police car in cuffs. My reply ok I will call my wife. When they took my blood at the Hospital it was 767. I had lost 20 lbs. in one week, @ 6’ 170 lbs I did not have much to loose. I did not realize my body was on the verge of shutting down. So there is the story. I know long winded! So if he has questions do not hesitate to ask. Fair warning though the rules of this subreddit do not allow medical advise. Please tell him to keep up beat and he can live life he just has to keep in mind it is not the same life."

There's no ""late onset,"" though. T1D happens to adults, teens and children just the same; but you won't hear about that in the majority of the literature or from most physicians. 

If they say he has LADA, ""Latent Autoimmune Diabetes of Adults,"" the word ""latent"" means ""undiscovered"" or ""hidden"" and it is only so because doctors don't test adults for autoantibodies enough because they falsely still believe that T1D autoimmunity is a ""juvenile"" disease. It just isn't so.

Hope he recovers quickly and finds a compatible doctor and insulin regimen, and ""lifestyle"" options that he finds acceptable. And best wishes with your pregnancy and managing the gestational diabetes, too of course. Sounds like the baby saved daddy some advanced health troubles already. 😇 (Just FYI, about half of gestational cases turn out to be early indicator of diabetes, and sometimes it turns out those cases are not insulin resistance/Type 2. If you have reason to suspect something isn't quite matching expectstions, you could also ask for antibody tests.)"

I'm glad you decided to go in. It's a tricky balance here sharing things like that because you don't want to give someone undue worry (or, in the opposite case comfort).

My uncle was diagnosed around that age ( I was quite young when it happened so don't remember exactly when). My cousin was diagnosed at 30. So yes, late, but not unheard of by any stretch.

Catching it before DKA or before the DKA was more serious is a great thing, although it might not feel like it now.

Good luck with this! The community here is very helpful and a great supplement to the clinical support you'll also be getting."

In short, I am pregnant and have mild GD and husband had been complaining about leg cramps for past few weeks. Yesterday morning we decided to check his BG by chance with my glucometer. The readings were twice the higher cut off for fasting and 4 times high after meals. I posted about it here and thanks to all the comments we did go and see an emergency doctor yesterday. Though the process was tedious with NHS due to weekend,we managed to get an early diagnose of husband’s Type 1 diabetes. 
As per the consultant this is late onset (he is 36) and his only symptoms were regular leg cramps and 7 kg weight-loss over past two months. He had no classic symptoms like thirstiness, tiredness, abdominal pain etc. 
No one in his family had diabetes so he never got tested either. He developed it in past few weeks and this was an early detection. He is been given insulin and will stay at hospital for observation for next few days. He will be on insulin doses and has a class tomorrow on T1D education. 
It was by sheer luck that we decided to check his glucose and captured early diagnoses. I am so thankful to this community to take time to write comments and push us to take faster actions.

Good to hear that you caught it before it got worse!! Learning curve can be a challenge, but lean in to community support and know that you’re not alone. There will be bad times but also good times. Take care and take it easy xx look out for T1 Facebook groups in your region/ location! :)"

My GD is definitely nothing compared to his prognosis and life long treatment with insulin and so different vs Type 2. We are learning on the go with amazing support team of nurses and doctors at our local hospital and from amazing contributors here.

You are right about doctors being reluctant to classify such diagnose as LADA, so thank you so much for sharing the reasoning behind it. 

Thank you for your wishes. I truly believe that my GD is a blessing in disguise. The amazing diabetic midwife team at my local hospital has helped me learn a lot about it and the high risk I possess afterwards for type 2.  The whole GD and T1 diagnosis has been nothing but a shock for our family since no one has diabetes and we both have been of healthy weight, active, cook and eat-at-home kinda couple, we don’t smoke and rarely drink alcohol. But anyway we are very motivated to love a full life with a strong community and family support. Thanks for suggesting the antibody test in case of abnormality. Its also the part of my regular check after the baby is born and yearly checks. 

I appreciate your comment ♥️"

Fasting - 17mmol/L, 19 mmol/L (we took two readings hust to be sure)
One hour after breakfast: 23.4 mmol/L
Before lunch: 18.6 mmol/L
After lunch: 29.8 mmol/L
Before evening meal: 19 mmol/L

We went to emergency around 7 pm in the evening and his blood glucose was consistently around 18-22 range. After receiving 10 units of long lasting insulin and 4 units of short one, his levels came down to 14-15 mmol/L after eating. 

Current levels are still around 14 mmol/L but he is only small dosage on insulin under observation at the hospital."

No fasting was required. They just measured his blood glucose every few hours (1.5-2 hours) taking into consideration if he had anything to eat and the timing of it. His readings were shot up regardless of meals. So thats how it was first indication of lack of insulin in his body."

During my time in recovery they were just giving me fast acting insulin not my regular meds and bolus. My avg oof sugar hovered around 9 mmols. Got discharged after 4 days and was back in nthe Er that night puking black puke. Er doc immediately diagnosed DKA.

No one in his family had diabetes so he never got tested either. He developed it in past few weeks and this was an early detection. He is been given insulin and will stay at hospital for observation for next few days. He will be on insulin doses and has a class tomorrow on T1D education.

After several bouts of pancreatitis, 9 MRI's, 5 CT scans and 3 endoscopies with biopsies in a 15 month period a tumor was found in my pancreas. I've had about 3/4 of my pancreas, my gall bladder and my spleen removed. I am now a type 3c diabetic. Type 3c is very similar to type 1 with some additional issues.
  Once diagnosed my endocrinologist typed me as a 
type 1.5 (LADA) for insurance purposes since type 3c is not always recognized.
  Long story short. I've read of how hard it is to live being an insulin dependent diabetic. I've not really found that in my case. It's just another part of my life. I have a CGM, a Dexcom G6.
  I take my basal in the morning, keep an eye on my sugar during the day. I count carbs and bolus accordingly for meals.
  What's left of my pancreas sometimes wakes up and decides to make some of its own insulin, and I'm also on steroids for other issues so I'm very familiar with the roller coaster, I'm a brittle diabetic.
  Every day it's a little different, adjust accordingly. My A1c is 6.3 and my Endo is very pleased with how well I do.
  The bottom line is how do you want to go through life? I'd like to keep my toes and eyesight so it's in my best interest to educate myself and stay on top of it. It really isn't that difficult.
  Tell your husband to keep his head up and stay on top of it, it does get easier with time. It just becomes a part of your life. Take a shot in the morning and carry a pen in your pocket count carbs and take a couple of shots during the day. Keep some carbs handy to help you out quickly if needed, glucose tablets, candy, crackers etc.
  Oh and a bonus is if he would happen to bolus more than needed for a meal it means that he can eat cake."

Type 1 is also an autoimmune issue and hits children (family member has had it since age 8). LADA is typically what they call it now when its slow in developing and doesn't hit until adulthood. I'm not sure when it became a separate designation, and it, likely many things, may not be used everywhere yet, but it's all in the name... Latent (resting or undeveloped, I like just saying ""late"") Autoimmune Diabetes (type 1) in Adults.

I am sorry about your diagnosis. Wow your A1c levels are amazing! My husbands results came in 2 days ago and his was at 14% so we cant even imagine what his body must have been going through managing that load. I am sure he wants to keep his toes and eyes as well 😅. He’s been super careful and with a lowerish dose of insulin that his diabeties team started him on , his numbers have started reaching single digit. He always has been fitness conscious (regular gym and running + Protien rich diet)  and barely ever has soda, so this diagnosis is a shock for us. However t1 is all a different ball game, we are learning more everyday. Its been tough but I believe he will make it like so many brave people like you in this unbelievably supportive community."
