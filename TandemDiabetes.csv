"Buying, Selling, Giving Away or Trading Trading Diabetes Supplies on this Subreddit","Hi there everyone!

I have recently had several complaints, as well as seen several posts of users attempting to buy, sell, trade, or giveaway diabetes supplies to others. While I believe this is a wonderful idea in theory, it is not accepted here on the r/TandemDiabetes subreddit.

One may ask why. For starters, according to a multitude of doctors and medical professionals I have spoke to, it is illegal to buy, sell, trade, or giveaway any diabetes supplies (let alone \*any\* medical supplies that require a prescription) to another individual. I have not been able to attain any other reasoning as to why this may be, other than the obvious possible liability issues involved. For those looking to sell, buy, trade, or giveaway their medical supplies to others, I highly suggest you contact your local hospital in addition to your endocrinologists.

With that being said, I cannot control what goes on between individuals who decide to privately message each other separate and apart from this subreddit, in regards to what I have just spoken about above. I will be adding a new rule to the subreddit that this is specifically not allowed.

I hope everyone is doing well with their lifelong journey of T1D!",https://www.reddit.com/r/TandemDiabetes/comments/tjnc6m/buying_selling_giving_away_or_trading_trading/,"['You raise some good valid points though I test strips are about the only thing you can legally do that with as most of them can legally be purchased over the counter though I could be mistaken.', 'Point being...instead of the powers that be regulating the cause of the problem, they allow the duty to regulate to fall onto you, which ends up being regulations against those who are already being harmed by the initial lack of regulation from those elected to protect our collective best interest.', ""It is quite ironic that there are no rules (see: laws) in place that are written to prevent the root cause of this sub's issue, as well as the root cause (one in the same) of the multitude of other problems (in the US) we face that are associated with insulin and diabetes products, in general.\nI'm fairly confident that if said root cause was rectified the issue of buying/selling/giving away of diabetes products would cease to exist.

Do I Have to Replace my t:slim at The End of Warranty?,"Tandem notified me that my t:slim will be out of warranty in a couple of months. My pump is working fine and has no cracks in it. I have very good insurance, but I assume there will be a decent cost for the new pump. 

What if I don't get a new pump? Will they still provide technical support when needed?

It can take weeks for insurance to work with the doctor to process claims right now, complaints over how long it takes have been on the rise in the last year or so. When our son got his pump 2 years ago, it took 6 weeks from the first call to the receipt of the pump with the back-and-forth paperwork and such required. That means if you don't do it when the warranty expires, then if your pump breaks or dies, you'll have to wait until that process is done to have a pump and go to backup methods in that time frame (MDI, old pump, whatever)"", 'Get the new on and keep your old one as a backup.

They asked who my insurance company was and when I told them BCBS, the rep was like, “Oh, yeah, you’re right”.  I’d also love to only pay $22 for 90 days worth of pump supplies instead of \\~$600.  Maybe I need to call BCBS and see if there is a way to get supplies covered under pharmacy, for me, now.

Unless that means that if something is ""wrong"" with it, they don\'t want it back and you get to keep it as a back-up.  I\'ve only been with Tandem since the beginning of the year, but when I used Animas pumps, you had to send your old pump back to them whenever you got a new one, even from insurance.  Hell, when Animas was closing shop in the US and I switched to Medtronic, Medtronic made me send them my old Animas pump, even though the warranty was up on it.', 'Interesting discussion.

My blood sugar is a disaster on Control IQ. My fault.,"I've had T1D for 20 years and have spent most of that time in the 5.7 (when pregnant) to 6.3 range with admittedly a lot of lows. Am lean, always moving, and definitely have always likely over basaled and probably had 3-5 minor, infrequently significant (40 mg/dL) lows a day. Not great for sure, but have never passed out, nor needed assistance, though of course am SO sick of that low feeling. I can feel my lows super strongly, well before they happen. Enter Control IQ a few years ago. Since I've been on it, my blood sugar has been wild--I can't seem to stop eating for lows (hate the feeling so much) and when the bolus suspend comes in, I'm spiking right back up, wayyy up. Then I'm stacking boluses on top of the pump's boluses because it doesn't correct me fast enough (like hours stuck at 250), then I'm double arrowing down all of a sudden. I've adjusted everything under the sun at different points and it doesn't seem to help. A1C has been stuck at 7.2, but it's a turbulent 7.2. Unfortunately I tried turning off Control IQ and things got even more wild--up at 400, needed to do a self micro glucagon with a neverending low etc. It's like I've forgotten how to be a diabetic, and I feel stuck. I do feel I want the Control IQ to prevent super lows; too dangerous esp w young kids. Endo is very good at tweaking but again, the tweaks don't seem to do enough. Couple additional things: I am a woman and do feel like the menstrual cycle makes it SO nuch harder (what works one day does not the next): not near menopause so has always been such. Also, I find Tandem and I aren't always friends/I'm a space cadet. Particularly when it runs out of insulin or battery in middle of night and I sleep through high. Finally and big issue likely is I have two toddlers and little focus for this PIA disease. I'm a medical journalist living in Boston so you'd think I'd be better versed and behaved. 

So frustrated and sick of it. BUT. Reading here for first time (such a font of info), I've gathered with my issues I should try: 1) Putting in sleep mode all day so pump and I aren't fighting on boluses/stacking like a team of fools every day. 2) Start correcting lows earlier (setting earlier low alert and having two tabs) so I'm not slamming tabs and having basal suspended at same time and feeling like you know what. I have been trying not to have tabs at all and it's just not working. I think I am prone to lows even without overbasaling (my hypothesis is because I'm lean with a lot of muscle?). I don't know. 

I have no complications at 20 years and would like to keep it that way. Thank you and sorry for the ramble.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TandemDiabetes/comments/14w894p/my_blood_sugar_is_a_disaster_on_control_iq_my/,"[""Our son has been on 24/7 sleep mode for 2 years now. No way I'd go back. This has been so much better for him and honestly (IMO) closer to how a pancreas works. That the pump doesn't start adding more insulin until BG is already going to high is a major issue. The increased basal as soon as BG starts rising is much more effective. His rollercoaster is much gentler since being on sleep mode. Highs aren't as big and come down faster, lows aren't as low.""]"
Autosoft 90 Painful Bolus,"Hey all, recently I've started to notice a pain like too much insulin being pushed out at once when doing boluses for meals and snacks.  I don't know what would cause this.  I had some pain with my old site and I just figured, old site, discomfort, whatever.  But since switching to a new site I am feeling the same feeling of like too much insulin being pushed out at a time and causing the pain of it going in.  Has anyone else noticed discomfort like this?

I thought at one point I saw an option on my pump to set how much insulin it pumps at a time, but I can't find anything like that. A friend of mine who has the same pump and setup as me recently had her pump start not recognizing the insulin in her reservoir, and I'm wondering if this is a similar thing happening, where my pump is just malfunctioning.

Edit: this is more of like a pinching feeling than a stinging that some people are referencing.

t:connect app gets worse by the day,"WARNING\*\*\*\*RANT AHEAD\*\*\*

When this app first arrived after strenuous testing with the FDA, it worked for me flawless... a top-notch effort.  Now with the FDA approval, are they actively working on sabotaging it????

For starters, IPhone12 user running current IOS.  Tandems latest t:connect update (end of May) has been some rookie sh\*t.  This has become useless and in the process killed a perfectly good phone battery.

Every time I open the app.. and I mean every, it says pump disconnected, Did you update your pump software?  Mobile bolus icon disappears and reappears at its own discretion.  It is using 50% of my battery daily if I leave it open, if I don't leave it running in the background, the graph will not populate further than 20 minutes back.

Before the last update, I could leave Dexcom and t:connect running in the background for 20-30 hours without charge, now, be lucky to make it until lunch.  Its almost like it is constantly reaching out to a server over and over and has ruined my battery.

Is tandem intentionally degrading the reservoir quality?,"I know they say you have to use a new reservoir every time, but since I’ve had a tandem pump I’ve been re-using reservoirs a few times before changing it. You can easily refill it on the go when you run out without having to carry around extras.

Kudos to Tandem Diabetes,"Kudos to Tandem Diabetes for finally stabilizing the t:connect mobile app on my Android 13 Samsung Galaxy S21 smartphone.

So, I stopped using the app for a month or so because it just became so aggravating to use.  A few weeks ago, I installed the t:connect app again to give it another shot, and I must say that it has worked perfectly ever since that day.

"When I remove AutoSoft XC insertion needle, the adhesive comes off.","I'm writing to see if anyone else has had this issue. I'm new to Tandem, coming from Medtronic. They recommended the AutoSoft XC infusion sets, and I went thru all the training and everything.

When I'm changing my site, after I trigger the spring to insert the needle and cannula into my skin, I press on the white tab thing a bit to help it adhere to my skin.

A couple times, though, the adhesive is not stuck well enough, so when I try to pull the needle out, the whole thing just comes off my skin.

Control IQ is trying to Kill Me,,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/14dyxk2,"['you may need to adjust your insulin sensitivity factor. control iq will bolus based on how much it thinks you’re rising, where it thinks you’ll end up at, and how much insulin you need to bring you back down to 110.\n\nalso, as someone else mentioned, you need way less to correct a low with control iq since it already tried to correct by limiting insulin. \n\nalso, 15g may have been overkill for barely\ndipping into the 80s — it’s entirely likely you would’ve ended up sticking in the 80s/90s without the gel.', ""The standard 15g every 15 mins for a low doesn't work with systems that slow/stop insulin for lows. The system's functionality combined with the carbs is too much, so you rebound, go high, and then your sensitivity is off, so your correction is too strong which sends you low again.   \nUnless our son was 80 and tanking (steep drop) or being active, we wouldn't even correct for a low of 80. Usually the system will then catch it by 70 and he'll come up without rebounding. We don't generally correct a low until it's in the 60s, depending on the details. Or, if he needs a boost we'll give carbs but then once his BG comes up, he enters some of the carbs to get the needed bolus. It's rare he ever needs more than 10g to correct a low, 4-8g is much more common. Your pump needs some setting adjustments, if you aren't sure what to change, or how, make sure your t:connect is current (upload manually or keep the app open so it uploads your info) and have your doctor look at it to help.   \nControl IQ can only adjust within a range of your settings. If your settings are off, it can only do so much either direction (preventing lows or combatting highs)."", ""I think you need to rethink what a low is. For most adults with a cgm and a closed loop pump you don't need to be alarming and treating at 80. 80 is a perfectly normal bg. The only reason I'd treat at 80 is during exercise or if I had a ton of iob, and even then I likely still have carbs digesting.

Tandem diabetes pump Vs Medtronic,"My endo is pushing me to the tandem and says the Medtronic 780 doesn’t have a good bs monitor. New pump would only cost me $500 because of trade in value ans I already have a surplus of supplies..

The pump will say 260+ until you use a certain amount of insulin (maybe 20 units). then it should reflect the accurate amount of insulin. I haven't seen 180... but if that is the case, call support. They specifically told me 300 is the MAX and allegedly some people don't typically fill it to max (but i do).\n\n2) I ran into something early on in my first year that had me up all night trying to figure out so hopefully this wont happen to you... but occasionally when you stick the needle into the cartridge to draw the air out... a tiny piece of the membrane can get stuck in the gauge of the needle. When I went to put the insulin into the cartridge I wasn't able to move the plunger down. In that scenario you just have to change the tip of the syringe and it will be fine....  It is rare but I had no idea what was going on and I did it multiple times in the same night...the trick is to insert the tip of the needle straight down in the center when drawing out the air and injecting insulin. Apparently someone sells a 3rd party tool to help align the needle but I haven't needed it..now that I know how to trouble shoot the stupid cartridge...\n\nThat's all i got - hope it helps!

And with some larger meals eg pizza I have to slit my total bolus to cover the meal between 4-5 boluses for the slow carbs. So I break down the whole bolus into 4's and it gives nice little hills vs the mountains that I see on your photo.\n\nAs another said perhaps your correction and what not needs to be tinkered with.  Maybe you should meet with a diabetic educator who can work with you to find how things work best for you and perhaps correct your correction factor.

Help with Tandem pump settings!,"Hello everyone, I hope you are all doing well!

So for some background, I was diagnosed on March 8th 2023, and just started using the Tslim pump several days ago. Prior to the pump I was taking 12 units total daily (9 levemir and 3 Humalog, my I:C is 1:30.)

Now that I am on the pump, my insulin needs have decreased, and my TDD is between 6-9. My basal is currently at 0.25/h

**The main issue I am having is that I am never in the range sleep mode is trying to target. I always hover around 7 mmol (126) during the night. My pump nurse says I can’t change any settings until I am taking at least 10 units total daily, since if I do up my basal the pump will just suspend. I do not like waking up at 7mmol (126), and really want to get that down.

So, what should I do in this situation?

However, the same goes if your max basal is set to .5 u/hour or 1, etc. Mine ranges from .25-.4 given on the profile and time of day and I regularly see it give me 1.1-1.3 units to help bring down a number.

t:slim x2 12h inactive alarm,"Hello my fellow Tandem x2 users, I hope you are well. I started my journey with this amazing device a few months and so far it has been a mostly positive experience, but there is something happening on the daily that I am getting a little annoyed. 

Usually, in the morning, my glucose is around 6 and I don’t eat anything until 10 am so I don’t need a correction. On the other hand, my last bolus is around 8 pm on the previous day when I have dinner.

How to start new Dexcom session on Tslim.,"Hello good people! I am super new to Tandem (just got my pump two days ago). This morning I needed to start a new Dexcom sensor session. Here’s what I did:

1. Stopped the current session on my pump 

2. Stopped the current session on the Dexcom mobile app

3. waited 20 minutes 

4. Started the new session on my Dexcom mobile app. I made sure to type in the sensor code rather than scan it 

5. Started the CGM on the pump (I choose not to input the sensor code on the pump as this is what my trainer told me). Note this is still while the sensor was warming up 

After the warmup period, I was forced to calibrate. I know this can happen when you scan the sensor code, but I did not do that.

I’m assuming this is an error on my part. What is the proper way to end/start a new sensor session while you are using the Tslim pump?

Is it me or the pump? Site leaking issues,"I started on T:Slim last year around this time and was using the Autosoft 90 insertion sets in the beginning months. If I was lucky they lasted the full 3 days before leaking, most times it would make it about 36 hours. 

Made a post here and many suggested switching to the TruSteel. Did that and it was going well for a few weeks and now I’m back to the same leaking issues. I really like the TruSteel and would like to keep using it but I’m not sure how to proceed. 

So my question is, is it me that is causing the issue with the sites? Or is it the infusion set?

Couple of facts/concerns that play into the decision:

- 20+ year diabetic and always used my stomach for pump sites. Maybe it’s too much scar tissue?
- Is there a deeper version or “athletic” version of the TruSteel that is not as prone to leaks? I find even trying to do a few simple rounds of sit-ups or a 30 minute workout leads to leaking. 
- I am losing trust and constantly watching the site for leaks instead of being hands off. 
- Sites are always shaved and use IV Prep prior to insertion. Rotated from side to side regularly. 
- Not a fan of the 30 or 45 degree infusion set options so I’m limited in 90 degree choices.

I have used tandem 2 years, medtronic 20.  I have had many many tubing sets go bad and get plugged after 2 or 3 days no longer letting any insulin leave the tubing.  Ive had many also get trapped air inside, which wont deliver the full amount of insulin or can block all insulin delivery completely.  Always chang the tubing out if you get trapped air bubbles inside it.  Ive had brand new autosoft 90 tubing that would not prime at all.  The id of the tubing inside was fused shut so it could not flow and was blocked.  The reservoirs also will go bad over time.  I just had one where i could deliver 10 units of bolus and the pump acted as if it was and thought it was delivering 10 units of bolus but i had the tubing disconnected at the set site and watched for insulin to come out and none did.  It did not give an occlusion error!  But no insulin left the tubing!  There was a small air bubble i watched just outside of the reservoir while it was doing this nonexistent bolus.  The air bubble would move forward a mm or so, then backward a mm or so every few seconds.  It ended up in the same place it started and no insulin left the tubing.  Now that was a bad reservoir as i replaced only that and it then behaved normally.  Now ive also had plenty of kinked set tubes that go under the skin.  That gets better with better set insertion technique and using a screwdriver to hold the tape down on one side under the insertion device after installed, a finger over the tubing coming out of the set on the other side, when pulling the 90 degree inserter off.  The screwdriver is key or it wants to tilt on the way out and could kink.  So in general there are all kinds of issues with tandem reservoirs, sets, and tubing.  I have not had a set leak at the body though.  Oh, another good one is the reservoirs will sometimes not register all the insulin you just filled them up with, like 100 units short.  Now you might think this is not a problem and it will work fine, it will just alert you early that its getting empty!  No! It uses pressurized air to deliver the bolus and that pressure is different with a defferent volume in the reservoir, so it basically gives the wrong amount of insulin when this happens.

You gotta push against the insertion spring (and push against the needle which feels kinda uncomfortable) and then when you pull it out, it really is stuck in there. \n\nIf the inserter would dislodge the needle after launching (and have it on some sort of grabbable platform) things would be a lot better. You could massage the bandaid to improve the sticking and pull the needle out while holding the port in place. \n\nThis is how my current pump handles it. You clip the catheter into the reusable inserter, then on launch it is completely disconnected from the launcher and you can take it off right away and start taking care of the thing.', 'I’m sure there is scar tissue after 20 years, I’d be surprised if there wasn’t haha. You are right though, some areas can be a bit tough or have a hard pocket that you can feel under the skin.

If you don't and your t:slim is in range of your sensor, Control IQ could deliver some insulin, which adds to your IOB (insulin on board), and would throw off future corrections, not to mention drip onto wherever you've placed your pump.  \n\nIf your showers aren't that long, this would make a very minimal impact, so you probably don't *need* to, but it's better if you can."", 'Yes suspend it- otherwise you’ll waste insulin.

It’s not a big deal either way as long as you’re not in the middle of a bolus or taking a long shower.', 'Yes also stop the insulin when disconnecting it from your body. Otherwise, you not only waste insulin but your IOB will be wrong and you might not get the right insulin correction and/or basal.', ""If you have ControlIQ, definitely suspend.  If it decides you need a correction rate or a correction bolus, your Insulin On Board reading may be very out of touch with reality.\n\nIf you don't have ControlIQ (auto-delivery due to CGM reading), then at most you'll miss is whatever basal rate would have been delivered during your shower.\n\nBack when the X2 first came out, my Diabetes Educator, who was herself using it, said to avoid suspending because the basal missed from a shower was negligible compared to what you might miss from forgetting to resume.  I regard that as very old advice, as the current firmware in the pump is very insistent if you forget to resume your basal."", 'Yes.  I’ve always suspended all of my pumps before disconnecting, over the last \\~15 years.

Haven't suspended for the shower."", 'I always suspended when showering with the 670G, but I’m now on the X2 (as of recent as well) and was told to suspend since CIQ will deliver the amount missed when you resume delivery.', ""really depends how long you shower and what your preferences are. If you shower for 10 minutes, eh, no big deal. If you shower for 30, then you might consider giving part of the missed basal as a manual bolus if you are worried about missing the insulin.

Waterproof case for t:slim pumps in Canada?,"I'm going on my first holiday in about 6 years. No kids, no spouse, just me and my friends and the plan is to be in the pool 24/7.

iphone 14 w/iOS 16 bluetooth disconnects,"I don't think I've gotten more than about an hour of bluetooth remaining connected.

Infusion sites not going under skin,"i’m new to insulin pumps because i’ve been using needles for the last 8 years.

Endo won’t prescribe Tandem anymore,"I switched from a Medtronic pump to t:slim back in late 2021, mainly because I despise Medtronic’s CGM with all of my soul. I had been using the Medtronic pump with Dexcom CGM which worked but made the pump’s auto-mode completely useless since it will only use the Medtronic sensor data. I switched to Tandem and I swear I have never thought less about my T1D and never had better control. 

My endo prompted the switch to tandem and was super amped about how great it would be (back in 2021) and everything has been smooth sailing since then. 

Until today. Suddenly he says when my warrantee ends I will have to go back on a Medtronic or Omnipod pump. No discussion, no exceptions. I asked if there were some new studies or data saying Tandem wasn’t safe, we’re they doing out of business, was Medtronic suddenly going to provide a God-level sensor and algorithm? Nothing. I got no information at all except that I was welcome to stay with Tandem but he wouldn’t be prescribing it.

Anyone have anything similar happen? Any breaking news or rumors that would explain this?

Getting around min 50 units in an emergency,"Last night around midnight I was getting ready to change my cartridge before bed when I realized I was missing a vial of insulin.  I should have had a spare but I don't know if I brought it to work, misplaced it on holiday or what.  There are no 24 hour pharmacies here and my pump had zero insulin left.  I tore the fridge and house apart and managed to find a mostly empty vial behind my dresser that expired last month.  Good enough in a pinch.  

Of course the amount came out to pretty much exactly 50 and I knew it wouldn't be enough for the min amount after priming.  So I put that 50 in the same cartridge I was using (since the tubing was already filled) and put it aside for the moment.  I took out a fresh cartridge, filled it with around 80 units of tap water, did the load process, primed the tubing, and then programmed the pump to do 30 units unplugged to get it to read around 55 units.

Once I had it down to where I needed it, I pulled out the water cartridge and threw it away, and popped the one with 50 expired units back in.  Of course, it wasn't ideal for my pump to now think I just gave myself 40 units of insulin, nor to waste a cartridge and syringe, but desperate times.  

Amazingly, the room temp, expired insulin has worked 100% fine.  I was able to go get new vials from the pharmacy today, but I'll just keep using this one until it runs out.

This is the only way I can possibly think to get around this when in an emergency so I hope someone else finds this useful in a pinch.

I find this is the easiest way to build a little backup up, keep ordering as soon as possible. I have my recurring set for 82 days and I adjust the date if I am busy and order a day late. Continuing to check supplies regularly is a good idea, but unless you order a 1 month supply this isn't the most efficient timing (and even with a 1 month supply you can usually order 3-7 days early which can help build reserves). Once you start to get a bit ahead keep at least a 1 month supply separated from the rest of your insulin (I have 3 months supply in reserve). If you tuck this in a back corner of your fridge and rotate it each time you get fresh supplies then you are always safe in case of an emergency.

Our son manages most of his site and sensory changes on his own these days so I try to rely on him telling us (since he'll be off to college soon and will need to manage) but with insulin, he also doesn't. We do have a bit of a cushion, but if he runs high from illness or whatever, the cushion isn't enough. I had to ask them to change his script a few months ago because he was running too low before insurance would refill and if he accidentally broke one or ran high from illness, we would have been in trouble. I had to argue with the nurse to increase it, which was annoying. With his pump supplies though his script is for site changes every 2 days, so we have quite a backstock now after 2 years of that because he mostly does every 3. In fact we just got the reminder to order supplies and I just opened the last box they sent, so we're basically a full 90 days ahead now which is nice. I wish we could do that with insulin 😂 For whatever reason they cut it a lot closer. He basically uses everything he has by the time he refills, even though we'll pull leftover insulin out of the cartridge if it's more than 20u, and so on."", ""It sounds like they are keeping him on too tight a prescription for insulin. Personally I use my maximum daily dose (my insulin use varies greatly) times 90 plus 60 units waste per cartridge (it typically takes me 30-35 units to clear all bubbles from my long tubing and there is always about 20+ units of waste at the end of a cartridge) times 45 cartridges in a 90 day window (my prescription is to change every 2 days, though I usually average every 3 days). I then take this result times 1.2 to account for dropped vials, illness, a leaky cartridge or bad set that wastes insulin, etc. I then round up to the nearest whole vial (even if I only have need of 5 units in the next vial I always round up). If you do all the math and hand it to the doctor to explain why you want a prescription for 12 vials, etc I have never had any issue. They have something perfectly reasonable to explain the request and you have some breathing room. Especially with your kid going away to college soon, his eating habits may change, his exposure to illness may increase, he will likely be under more stress, etc. It is important that you ensure he isn't concerned with running out of supplies. If you run the numbers and contact the endos office for a prescription change you may want to use the fact that he will soon be away from home and not able to get supplies quickly in an emergency as a good reason for making these changes. Most doctors will also write a 1 month prescription for emergency supplies if you ask. \n\nDepending how far from home your kid is going to be, you might consider keeping some emergency supplies at home that you could deliver in an emergency. You can always try to rotate them at Christmas and in the summer. Insulin has a 3 year manufacturers expiration, so its not a big problem if it doesn't get rotated perfectly. It can be really hard to get supplies in an emergency if you don't have transportation and need to depend on a mail order pharmacy! I went to college about 3 hours from home, back in the late 90s. They mailed me my prescriptions (before mail order was an actual thing - with my insurance anyway) and it worked great. I always kept supplies stocked at home though, and my dad came up to visit every couple of weeks, so he could have brought me supplies in a pinch. It made it so I didn't need to worry about bringing sufficient supplies for Thanksgiving vacation or a weekend at home and gave me peace of mind that I wouldn't have to worry if I dropped a vial of insulin or something. I had no access to medical care on campus (small school) but knew in a pinch my family would be there to help. I never had a problem - I am a bit OCD to begin with about supplies, backups, rotating medications, etc - but it was one less reason to stress."", 'He\'s got a few years left yet, so not sure on the distance. If he actually sticks with where he\'d like to go now, he\'d be about 300 miles away. Doable in an emergency, but 5 hours drive. He would have other family closer, so it might be feasible to have them store a backup supply for him. His brothers went to the same school so on the plus side we know their have a very good on-campus pharmacy, at least. \n\nOn the insulin, it\'s dumb because that is largely the nurses. When we actually get to talk to the doctor, he is amazing and always agrees with our request to raise his insulin needs because he\'s known us for years and knows we aren\'t just wasting stuff. But we live 2 hours from the clinic and all messages are routed thru nurses who often don\'t know us, and then they are like ""You\'re probably wasting insulin."" Well, no, we\'re not, but thanks 😆']"
New cartridge detects more units than loaded.,"First time pump user with t:slim x2. On my third cartridge. Second stated I had 150u after loading 120u. I delayed replacing it by 8 hours since it told me I had units left. Big mistake. Realized it wasn't giving me insulin when it said it was. Assume it was empty. Now in third cartridge and see it states 150u again after loading 120u. 
I did remove air from cartridge, what else could I have done wrong?

Edit: spoke with my educator today and learned the initial number after a refill is not really accurate until over a certain bolus is delivered. My thinking that there was no insulin being given must have been new user error.

Filling several cartridges,"Newbie on Tandem
Started slim x2 yesterday and learned how to fill a cartridge from a vial.  
I have been wondering: is there any issue with filling in advance two or more cartridges? This would be handy when travelling; less messing around with syringe etc.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TandemDiabetes/comments/13ohr99/filling_several_cartridges/,"['Apparently the plastic inside the vial degrades the insulin but I know several people on here say it hasn’t influenced their BGL', 'I was advised not to pre-fill cartridges at my training, the reasoning being that the little plastic bag can start to degrade the insulin when left in there too long. Just pop the glass vial back in the fridge', ""When I was using Lyumjev I found the longer it set in a cartridge the more it had a tendency to burn. Usually on day 4 (me being cheap and not wanting to toss 30+ units in the trash) it would burn like bees stinging me. Talking with my diabetes educator at the time, she said it degraded the bag in the cartridge causing the interaction since I didn't have issues with it while on MDI.  I am on Novolog now and don't have any issues short if it takes about 5 minutes longer before the insulin kicks in."", 'My husband had been the only one filling cartridges for a while(I was anxious and nervous about it but I’m not anymore) and if he went out of town, he’d fill extra cartridges. No issue and honestly seems like the bubbles dissipated and I didn’t have to push as much insulin through the line. That being said, I’d still bring extra empty cartridges and insulin when going out of town, just in case.', 'Tandem, the manufacturer,  recommends not to prefill cartridges, and their answer is degradation of insulin. They do not sell less cartridges if one prefills, so profit motive is not a consideration. As a medical company, the only other reason would be protection of its clients.', ""I've asked this exact same question, and had several different types of responses.\n\nThe only reason. I wouldn't is because I remember one redditor responding with a direct link from Tandem stating Novolog insulin shouldn't be kept in a cartridge longer than 72 hours, and Humalog insulin shouldn't be kept in a cartridge for longer than 48 hours. There was no reasoning as to why this was said, so I can only assume that they say this because this is the longest it has been tested for each type of insulin to safely stay in the cartridge.\n\nI like to think about this (any many other questions) starting with logic; according to a quick Google search, plastic takes anywhere from 20 years to 500 years to decompose. I can only assume this means to *fully* decompose, but even with this said, 2-3 days is such an insignificant amount of time, I cannot imagine it having any sort of decomposition or negative effect in conjunction with the insulin. Even if the insulin were kept in the vials for weeks or months, it is still virtually incomparible to the time frame that the *earliest* of plastics would decompose, whether partially or fully.\n\nIn addition, from much personal experiences, I have never found to have an issue keeping several cartridges filled in the fridge (I usually don't do more than 3 because I am still a bit of a worrier). I have also used cartridges countless times longer than 3 days, with no issue (to my knowledge) of the fact insulin itself, only if I don't change the infusion site (in which I am much more likely to have occlusions)."", 'An interesting find:\n“We conclude that premeasured insulin may safely be stored in plastic disposable syringes under selected conditions, especially in blind and handicapped diabetic patients, for 2 weeks.”\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3550783/#:~:text=We%20conclude%20that%20premeasured%20insulin,diabetic%20patients%2C%20for%202%20weeks](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3550783/#:~:text=We%20conclude%20that%20premeasured%20insulin,diabetic%20patients%2C%20for%202%20weeks)', 'This is a good question.

The issue with Fiasp is that the stuff they add to it to make it act faster (basically a B vitamin) reacts strongly to heat and turns into gel, making the insulin unable to flow properly. It is possible it's a bad box of sets, that does happen sometimes.

Case recommendations PLEASE,"Update: 
I ended up ordering a case with a rotating clip from Amazon because it will be here tomorrow and I really can't wait while I research a longer term solution.  I clip my pump to my bra a lot, or just tuck it into my bra, so something a bit lower profile would be appreciated.  If anyone has other recommendations for a clip that rotates or one that has the orientation the reverse of the native tandem case, please link.  I don't understand why the tandem case is oriented the way it is to begin with.  I'm not trying to show the world my pump numbers, I'm trying to see them, therefore the case should be oriented in the reverse so when you look down on your waist, you can see the screen.  Am I the only one that thinks this is preferable?  This was the think that made me the craziest when I switched pump manufacturers.

Metal clip and other cases,"Hello!! I’ve had the x2 for just a few months over a year now and my metal clip on the case has gotten super stretched out lately, to the point where I lean forward or bend down and the pump just slides off my waistband completely because it’s not tight enough to hold. I was reading through threads and saw advice for bending it back or buying new cases that are more durable, but my issue is that all the cases I’m seeing or that have been suggested seem SO bulky. I know the durable aspect is going to give some bulk, but the main appeal of this pump for me was that it was slim (especially over my old super bulky medtronic). I was wondering if anyone knew of any clip on cases that are going to be more durable but not super bulky, meaning around the same size as the case the pump comes with ? If I have to deal with the clip stretching and bending it back just to have this slim case then I will, but ideally I’d like to avoid this problem but not have a super bulky case.

They do say first pump with firmware updates but who knows if the new features of the X3 software will be updated on X2 or if most of the changes will be hardware based.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TandemDiabetes/comments/13j73om/tslim_x1_now_or_wait/,"['I am in Canada, and as far as I know, the X2 has been out for a while in some countries. X2 is indeed software upgradable and is been great to me.

I watched a video recently of the Guardian 4 insertion process, and it’s crazy complicated. Dexcom/Libre are so much better.\n\nI will say, however, that Medtronic’s infusion sets are much better than Tandem’s. That’s an area Tandem needs to focus on.

When I was with Animas and on my second Ping, they finally released the Vibe in the US market(\\~2 years after releasing it in the UK)(first pump with Dexcom integration- display only) and you could trade your Ping in and get the Vibe for \\~$700.\n\nBottom line: If you want to get on a T:slim, go ahead and do it, now.', 'The X3 will probably come out between 2024 and 2025.

But they have said that the form factor will be different than the X1 and X2. \nWhat was said at an investors call, was that it would have the capability of doing over the air updates, USB Type C, operating system would be changed and be more modern looking. Control IQ would see an upgrade as well, but the internals are going to be better than the t:slim X2, so that updated Control IQ would probably be exclusive to the X3.

My current waste with the 670G is very minimal for a complete change.  But, my understanding is there is a loss of insulin once the X2 says ""empty"" because it cannot fully drain the bladder vs. the 670G type pumps that can completely empty.  Is that right?  I\'ve read the total loss can be ~60-70 units. The cost of insulin, at least here in the states, makes me consider every unit sometimes..', 'The total loss seems to be in the \\~45 unit range(and is what Tandem states in the manual, last I checked).  I typically fill my reservoir with \\~165 units.  The line fill is \\~12 units.  By the time the pump ""settles""(the + goes away) and gives me a remaining unit count, it\'s typically 120-125 units.\n\nTwo things I do miss about Medtronic is the low waste of insulin(basically just the line fill) and precision of the remaining units in the reservoir(my 630G was precise to the 1/10 of a unit, in the menu view).

Now, I also had plenty of old cartridges from around the same time (I hoarded new ones by reusing old ones) and figured I might as well clear that stock too. Aside from one bad cartridge (after a second refill, my pump threw an error message and said to replace the cartridge now, so something inside may have broken) the rest of the cartridges worked with no issues, although the white rubber nub on the end (to pierce it and fill with insulin) was stiffer/dryer than usual.\n\nOverall, not a fun thing to be doing, but I got to keep using my pump and all the controls it offers, while my insurance figured out their mess…', ""We have worked up to always keeping a supply overage, but we try to cycle them by date so if they expire it's not too far gone.

Loading cartridge/reservoir,"Overall this pump is pretty great. Ive had it roughly 8 months now and it has been a drastic improvement from my previous (medtronic) in terms of lowering my A1C, communicating with the dexcom, and overall management.

My one issue is the cartridge loading process. Everytime i load in more insulin i feel like im losing 15+ units and constantly have insulin squirting out of the membrane when i remove the syringe. 

Does anyone else have a similar issue/more efficient loading process?!?",https://www.reddit.com/r/TandemDiabetes/comments/13d6uwc/loading_cartridgereservoir/,"['I noticed the problem stopped when I started removing air from the cartridge the correct way.

Are you removing the air from the reservoir before you fill it and how much insulin are you attempting to fill it with?

When we do a new cartridge, we fill the syringe with insulin, then put the syringe into the cartridge and pull the air out until the big bubbles stop coming out. Then we remove the syringe, squirt the air out of it, and then put the insulin in the cartridge. For whatever reason, I have found if we don't remove the air while there is insulin in the syringe, we tend to have more issues. The insulin being there makes it so you can see when bubbles/air stops coming out of the cartridge."", 'So, I\'m kind of in the same boat. I was on Medtronic for about 10 years and switched to Tandem about 3 months ago and it\'s been pretty life changing. I haven\'t had the same issue with insulin squirting out of the membrane as excessively like it sounds like you\'re having, I\'ll have 1 maybe 2 units come back out, but overall a very small amount. I\'d recommend trying to keep your hands steady and keep the needle perpendicular to the membrane so it doesn\'t damage it.\n\nI have another trick to kind of cheat the system to squeeze as much insulin out as I can. I don\'t recommend doing this especially if you are planning on being somewhere away from your supplies, but this helps me cut down on supply usage. I use one cartridge per bottle of insulin. The thought is there is a base amount of insulin that kind of gets eaten by the bag not squeezing out everything so if I refill the same cartridge I don\'t waste that amount every couple of days. Also if I have a set that feels secure by the end of the cartridge, I\'ll add another 100 units to make sure the whole bottle of insulin gets used without having to mix bottles or have a 1 day set change. I am 6\'6"" and about 250lbs and go through about 70 to 80 units a day so filling a cartridge to 300 units and riding it to empty is not a big deal with the amount I take. \n\nI heard some people talking about how the bag can cause the insulin to go bad over a couple days. I had done some research into a study looking at the effects of long term exposure to IV bags to insulin. I believe they had found a slight drop in the effectiveness of the insulin, but it was within the single digit percentage points and I figured that was good enough for me. I don\'t have the study saved, but I can find it if anyone is interested. \n\nAnyway, that\'s how I save a little bit of money and insulin, definitely don\'t recommend it for most people, and if anyone does decide to try this use your best judgement. If something feels like it needs to be replaced, replace it.', 'How do you describe the correct way?

Thank you Tandem.,"Insulin dependent Type II.

My last A1C was 5.7, thanks to the pump.

I've had to stretch my insulin for a bit and trusting that my basal/bolus rates were dialed in, I started deliberately letting the Conteol IQ manage boluses unless I knew I was taking in a lot of carbs at once.

Dexcom,"Hello Tandem Fam!

I wanted to ask how folks have been managing dexcom sensor change days? 

I find with all the false low alerts & inaccuracies while the sensor settles for the first 24hr that I have to manage my sensor change days around my days off of work due to how disruptive and inaccurate it can be. 

I have found calibration never works so I end just baring with the alarms the first day and night with no sleep & higher bg due to how off the sensor is the first 24. I tried turning off control iq but should blood have been on the sensor needle I find the alarms on LOW will override regardless if CIQ is on or not. I should note I do all the things to support accuracy: hydration, tenting skin while inserting etc. the only thing I have not tried is soaking the sensor. 

To me, this has been the biggest drawback with my switch from mdi to tslim x2/dexcom g6. Just wondered if anyone has had this same issue/s around sensor change days?

We haven't had a false low on sensor day in more than a year. \n\nA couple other things we do: ensure proper hydration before the sensor change. Check BG 1 hour into warm up. Then check it again when the sensor comes online."", 'Thank you! Do you notice a difference with accuracy whether the site around the sensor needle bleeds slightly or not?', ""For me I definitely get a lot of false lows initially with sites that bleed, but then after 24 hours they'll be some of my most accurate sensors.

Time that the current cartridge will last?,"I'm having a problem determining how long my current cartridge will last.

On the home screen I can see how much insulin is remaining in the cartridge but on my old medtronic pump I could bring up a display that would take in my basal profile (varying amounts per hour) and inform me how many hours and minutes before the cartridge was empty.

This was really handy before bed as checking this before bedtime allowed me to decide to change the cartridge then or reassured me that my cartridge would last overnight.

Overnight you are unlikely to use more than half of your total daily bolus dose, so you can use that as a rough guideline to help you decide. My general philosophy is, "" if in doubt, change it out!"".

I then restarted the sensor as normal, and got the full 10 days out of it.\n\nI just hadn't waited long enough between ending the previous sensor session and starting the next one.\n\nIf you want to go the less hacky way of fixing it, I imagine Dexcom's support would send you a new sensor if you explained the issue to them. They're pretty good in my experience."", '...I just went through this same scenario...tried pulling the transmitter and waiting 30 minutes...nope...tried using a different sensor code...nope...so I just pulled the sensor out and am waiting to try a completely new one...if it doesnt work, I am sort of flummoxed..', ""Our son gets the same sensor code like 50% of the time (9117 ftw). We just make sure that the connection has stopped before inserting the transmitter onto the new sensor. If it's still reporting on the dexcom app, we wait. Usually if we keep the transmitter upstairs and he goes down to his bedroom, it disconnects by the next 5 minute update. But if he keeps it closer it takes longer, closer to the 15-20 minutes that they recommend. But we do it as long as it's showing the sensor stopped reporting. As someone else mentioned, you can use something like a test strip or a guitar pick to dislodge the transmitter, wait, and then put it back on and it'll pick up again and work without having to pull the sensor."", 'try to wait 15-20 minutes between sensor sessions. i do that every time regardless of sensor codes cuz otherwise it’ll ask for a calibration usually', 'This is the way!!! Nothing better than a nice hot naked (no devices) shower. I have mine timed to do just that. Usually gives me a good 30 minutes from the old sensor to the new one.', ""Thanks! I ended up ringing them and they are sending a replacement. The agent said that I needed to give it 15-20 minutes before inserting a new sensor even if the codes were different. When I said I was surprised that I'd had the same code twice, she said there were only about 10 codes in use (?!).\nAnyway, I'd never restarted a sensor before but it seemed really wasteful to just pull this one off so I googled 'restart Dexcom g6' and found that you can stick a test strip between the transmitter and sensor to restart it. Today I learned! One thing I don't understand is why they only use 10 codes when it's a 4 digit number...\nDisclaimer: I'm not condoning this or recommending it"", ""This worked for me, in case you ever have the same thing happen again:\nTake a test strip and insert it between the transmitter, and the sensor, from the narrower end and push all the way to the wider end. Your goal is to come between the two round contact dots and the sensor which makes the transmitter think it's disconnected. Leave the strip there for 20 minutes then remove and attempt to start the sensor again. Surprisingly this worked straight away."", 'Lol.. mine was 9117 also 😅', 'I believe the codes just group sensors into bins of calibration / sensitivity, to help the algorithm turn the sensor signal into an accurate BG value. Test strips for finger sticks used to be the same way, until they improved to the point that variability was low enough that “no-code” strips could be introduced.', '..tried that also and nothing...it seemed the app was stuck on ""Start Sensor""...we tried popping the transmitter again with the new sensor after it said ""Replace Sensor"" again and when we put the transmitter back in, it just said ""Start Sensor"" again...and in a few minutes we got ""No Restarts""...so I finally just deleted and reinstalled the app and it seems to be okay...it is still in the warmup stage so crossing fingers....what a mess...', 'Oh that is annoying! Hope this one works for you and you can get the faulty one replaced']"
Control-IQ or Basal-IQ?,"I am about to switch to Tandem with Dexcom and wonder which would be better for me at least as a start. I have a 3-months H1Ac 6.4 and virtually no lows, as the CGM warns me and I am generally pretty aware of my blood sugar, esp thanks to my watch display.  I sometimes forget to bolus when eating, exercise at home in a planned fashion.
  What do you recommend, or how should I think about the choice?",https://www.reddit.com/r/TandemDiabetes/comments/12tyfjh/controliq_or_basaliq/,"['I’m on basal iq. It’s ok. Not great for me. I have pretty bad insulin resistance that means I can’t use control iq (I use more than 3 units per hour during parts of the day). For me basal is ok. Not great but ok. It shuts off insulin and then poof I’m over 200 for hours if I don’t catch it. I’ve learned I can not eat if it shuts insulin off. So that’s frustrating at times. \n\nI had good control without it (A1c in the low 5s while in range around 80%). Using basal iq my A1c has increased to the upper 5s but I have less lows and more highs. In range less. Since the less lows is what we were trying for it’s ok for me.', 'If I recall, basil IQ only  cuts out when going low. Controll will ramp basil down, then cut out if needed, as well as increase basil when going up and bolus for corrections. (Helping on the occasional missed bolus)\n\nIt takes a little while to tweak the settings, but I’m 3 years into CIQ and can say it does a pretty good job. I have to remind myself to not over correct and remember it’s done some corrections in the background. You do have to retrain your thoughts.\n\n6.3 a1c, 75%time in range', 'T1 for 37 years, pumping since 2008 and on Dex since 2015.\n\nIs the T:slim perfect?  Not hardly.  I have a laundry list of complaints, but…  I switched from Medtronic to Tandem in January 2022 and by the spring/summer(enough time to get a real idea, \\~3+ months), it had helped drop my average BS \\~40 points, increase my TIR(80-140) \\~30-40 percentage points, tighten up my standard deviation noticeably and drop my a1c a point.  I also settled on running Sleep Mode 24/7 instead of just regular CIQ, as it is more aggressive(adjusts with basal only, no auto-correction boluses, but does it much sooner).\n\nI‘ve also never had any issues with the infusion sets, as many others say they do.  But I’ve also been running the Autosoft 90’s since I first started on a pump, back with Animas, almost 15 years ago and I’m very meticulous with how I handle my site changes, and I think that is key, as I think many of the reported problems (bent/kinked cannulas) are due to “user error”.  I have had occlusions, but I’ve never had to pull a site early, because it completely stopped working.  Usually just restarting the bolus has always cleared it and worked for me.  Quick back-of-napkin math puts me somewhere between 1,500+ to 1,700+ site changes, and I’ve never lost one early due to bent/kinked cannulas or blockages/occlusions.\n\nOP, if you’re not sure which way you want to go, you can order the pump with Basal IQ and if you decide you want Control IQ later(most people get the pump as CIQ to start), you can update the software/firmware after the fact, as long as the pump is still in warranty.  But CIQ is forever CIQ, meaning if you order the pump that way, it cannot “downgrade” to BIQ and once you update the software/firmware on a BIQ pump to make it CIQ, it’s a one-way trip, as well.  And even though the selling point of the T:slim, in my opinion, is CIQ, you can always turn it(orBIQ) off and it functions as a normal “dumb” pump.\n\nTo me, it’s the best commercially available FDA approved looping option that is currently available.', 'Neither one works for me at all after switching from medtronic.  Wish i never did.  I have delayed absorption and insulin resistance, and variable site quality, all of which make the one size fits all tandem control and basal iq algorithms overshoot, undershoot, and go crazy frequently.  My sugars go out of control using them and dont recover.  They ADD to insulin resistance over time too, joy, as giving you an extra 20 units a day or 50 beyond what you need forces your liver to kick in and release stored sugars, over time creating more permanent insulin resistance for you.  Tandem is a good idea, hastily put together, and poorly executed for the average shorter term diabetic only, not those having it 20 years or more.  I also have found terrible manufacturing and design problems with the tubing in their sets, leading to frequent and random blocked insulin.  I changed out two new tubing sets just yesterday for blockages.  Its a real problem.', 'Do they still offer pumps with just BIQ? They might, I\'ve just only seen that they offer CIQ. Our son has been on the pump 2 years and never had BIQ but we also requested CIQ. Previously he was on Medtronic\'s 540 and then 670G with automode. For our son, CIQ has been much better. His A1C dropped a full point and his TIR is usually above 80%. He\'s 14 so dealing with puberty and growth spurts and CIQ has handled it awesomely. The only thing I preferred about Medtronic\'s system is the reservoir and fill process. That was a better system. But CIQ has been fantastic and we are big fans. \n\nCIQ will only kind of help with something like missing a bolus. It is better than no action at all (like a ""dumb"" pump or MDI) but it can only increase insulin within a range of your settings, and it doesn\'t know you missed a bolus so it can\'t, for example, suddenly give 5 units that was supposed to be your dinner bolus. You won\'t go as high, but you\'ll still go high and it can take hours to bring down if you just let CIQ do its thing. Our son actually runs in sleep mode full time because it just works better for him that way. It increases the basal immediately, whereas normal mode won\'t start increasing until you are 150 (if I remember right) and then doesn\'t give autocorrections until you are 180. We just find the more aggressive basal in sleep mode works better for him than the autocorrections.', 'Control. Why bother with just half the capability?', ""Also, if you're running a bit low and BIQ has stopped your basal, it won't let you pre-bolus for a meal. CIQ has fixed that, it will just reduce the amount it recommends you take for the carbs. Definitely CIQ, much better"", 'Thanks a lot for the perspective and actionable advice.  I hope they let me pick which one I want.', 'Interesting that others have had issues with kinked canulas!

I conclude from your experience that Control-IQ will cause less problems, right?', 'I went though about 5-6 months of this. It turns out my settings compared to my mini med were completely different.

You said yourself that you have delayed absorption and insulin resistance, both of which are going to make control for you more difficult than someone without.  I\'ve been a T1 for 37 years, pumping for the last \\~15 and on a T:slim for approaching 1.5 years.  Is the T:slim perfect?  Negative...

I definitely prefer the Medtronic sets but I love Control IQ so the trade off is worth it.', 'Its a more recent thing.  It is a manufacturing of tubing issue.  I found several tubing sets that would not prime new out of the package.  I could find inside the tubing where the id went to zero and was closed off.  Others have failed at the end connection with the set.  Its a serious problem not addressed yet by tandem.  Medtronic sets are bigger id, bigger od, and thicker wall.  All of these avoid problems with blockage.  Ive had several sets that become blocked in the tubing itself after using fine 1 day first.  Kinks are very easy with tandem.  Air bubbles also get trapped inside easily with tandem.  Its not a robust tubing design.', 'No control iq goes bonkers faster.  Basal iq goes bonkers over a couple hours.  Neither one works.  If you have insulin resistance as a type 1, consider getting on metformin 500 mg extended release only two times a day.  It helps insulin resistance by maybe 25 percent.  It helps me feel better with better metabolism too.  Too much metformin or regular not extended release can cause intestinal problems.  If you dont want to or cant stomach metformin, i also take berberine 1200 mg 2x a day.  Berberine is a natural herb that has the same effect in reducing insulin resistance as metformin but via a different mechanism, so are cumulative.  Using metformin and berberine is a much much much better health benefit for me than going to tandem, whose only real help for me is being linked to my dexcom g6 i got with it.  Dexcom is a game changer, but you dont need a tandem at all to use a dexcom g6.  I tried the older medtronic cgm and they did not work for me at all, useless.  Medtronic cgm tech is way way way behind dexcom and useless, but their basic pump setup and sets and tubing is robust and good.  Old minimed was way way better than every medtronic since however.', 'Yes thats not at all what im talking about.', 'It causes insulin resistance over time when the control and basal iq programming forces spikes in insulin bt over correcting.  Then the liver diesnt know what to do and must release stored sugars.  This then causes even more insulin given by control and basal iq.  It becomes an out of control system quickly.  Im not so much a fringe case as a common normal long term 20 plus year type 1 diabetic case.  Tandem needs to allow for changes in its control system.  It needs to go away from a one size fits all approach, as it does not, and in fact causes damage over time.  Some simple knobs on the control system can improve it significantly.', ""I agree, it's a much better system.

New Pump questions,"Hi, 
My child is a T1D and we're in the process of getting her Tandem.  We actually have,  just waiting on all the classes and such before she can start using it. 

Question I have is: You replace the infusion site every 3 days.  How do you go about finding a new site every 3 days?  I'm imagining  all accross her belly, maybe on a leg... Like I said we haven't gone thru any of the classes yet, maybe they cover it there.  I'm just looking for user-experience.

Also any tips for her for bed time ?  I have a cpap, so I know about trying to sleep with crap dangling off you,  but with the small tube and the pump,  what seems to work the best?  We gotten her some soft belts that the pump can rest in.  

we're still in the don't know what we don't know phase.  She's excited to start it, the idea of have less injections is a big win for her.    

Granted she's not asking these questions yet, I'm hoping to have some answers for her when she starts asking.  

Being the Parent, I'm excited and kind of scared,  I like being able to control the insulin she gets, but injections are a PITA.  

Thanks for any answers.   She was diagnosed, last June,  we luckily caught it early so she wasn't Ketonic when we found out, and with the CGM we've been lucky so far.   And I learned to thank God for an undisturbed night's sleep.   She's a trooper though, I have to say.

Download mobile bolus feature for tandem pump,"Hello,

Changing between Autosoft XC and Autosoft 30,"I've been on the pump for 3 years now and absolutely love it--but for the first time, I'm experimenting with an infusion set that isn't an auto soft XC.  The XC works fine, but as an extremely active and lean person, I have a lot of trouble finding more than 2 good spots per side to use them.  I often find myself in a situation where insulin resistance seems high on the day after insertion, only to find a bent canula when I change it.

Tandem X2 with control IQ does increase basal rate or decreases basal.You have to keep it in sleep mode 24/7. It does a much better job than omnipod 5. Probably because The X2 has a 30 minute prediction Opposed to Omnipods 60 minute prediction. With Tandem it's kinda like you get 2 different pumps. Normal mode will give a large correction bolus 60% of your correction factor. It will increase basal when at 160 if that does not bring you down it initiates an automatic correction bolus. Here's why I say it's like two different pumps. If you leave sleep mode on and don't ever turn it off it will only increase or decrease basal rate according to your CGM readings , no automatic correction bolus will be given. The range is much tighter between 110 - 120 in sleep mode. Normal mode has a range of 110 -180. Neither pump has any type of learning, both go off of Total daily dose. Omnipod 5 takes longer to get a history of total daily dose . When you first start tandem X2 with control IQ it asks for your weight and approximate total daily dose per day.

I found Tandem to work the best but Omnipod is ok to but not as good as Tandem. I noticed when I was using humalog I didn't get very good results with the pumps. They would take a long time to bring me down. I finally switched to Fiasp insulin. Peak time is much quicker so I think it helps out the algorithm a little bit. I also noticed with Fiasp the tail on the insulin doesn't seem to last as long. Why don't you try switching insulin try Fiasp brings you down a lot quicker.\n\nFirst generation of Tandem wasn't very good no control IQ it has since changed. If you are in fact using tandem with control IQ. I had to manipulate my basil rates slightly bring it a little higher than I normally would have it and I also had to come down my correction factor a little lower. The number one thing that helped me was keeping the tandem with control IQ pump in sleep mode all day long never turn it off. Another thing which most people have a hard time doing is to let the algorithm do the corrections for you don't intervene it does take a little time to bring you down but it will infect work. I can't stress it enough do not intervene with the algorithm let it do the corrections for you. It may take 2 hours but it will bring you down. Sleep mode is also a big deal, range is much tighter. I also noticed the tandem infusion sets  are not that great, sometimes if you have a bent canula it will get some absorption but it's not good enough so that algorithm seems like it isn't working. Went to the endocrinologist just the other day I have an A1C of 4.8. it has been like that for years and years. I don't do manual corrections I just put the pump in sleep mode and leave it there. However once in a great while if I am extremely high like 200 I will then do a manual correction. Of course when eating you have to give a food bolus. I noticed with tandem doing an extended bolus is the best option when eating. For me I usually do 50/50 depending on what my blood sugar is at the time. Control IQ does work the algorithm is good. If it isn't bringing you down when you are a little high then increase your basal rate and come down more with your correction factor. If it is bringing you too low. Then come down with your basil rate and go up with your correction factor. You have to get The Sweet spot. You don't have to have things exactly perfect but you have to be in the general ballpark area. Sometimes it takes a little while to get things right but once you hit that spot things go real smoothly from that point on."", ""Maybe, some things are not so great on Loop. I didn't like the 5-hour prediction way too long.on loop Of course everybody has different settings but if the algorithm isn't working correctly for you, is because either your basal rate is too low or your correction factor is off. The algorithm goes off of your total daily dose but if you are doing a manual correction or a food bolus when control IQ is on and it isn't bringing you down correctly then you're settings are not correct. Either your basal rate is too low or your correction factor is too high. The algorithm goes off of trendgraph movement CGM readings. Similar to openaps or loop. Openaps has no extended bolus o found that problematic when eating. Also it gives insulin according to your correction factor, it your high and it starts giving you corrections according to your correction factor but you start coming down to quick it will continually sispend on openaps until the predicted glucose has changed. So if anytime during the 5-Hour prediction it sees you may go low it will suspend even if the low isn't going to occur for 3 hours. From my experience the 5-Hour prediction for glucose values are inaccurate. You cannot change insulin duration either at least not on Loop. However you can't do this on tandem with control IQ either it is hard set to 5 hours. But the prediction is 30 minutes opposed to 5 hours . Tandem has a 30 minute prediction opposed to a 5-hour prediction on openaps or loop. I found tandem with control IQ to work better than the loop systems or openaps. I put control IQ in sleep mode I increase my basal rate and I put a lower correction factor in does quite well keeps me in good range. If I did that with Loop or open APS it would bring me low all the time. That's what I do but what works for me may not work for everyone.""]"
Autosoft,"Hi

So I'm currently on Medtronic and use Mio Advance infusion set's,. previously used Mio which is same as tandem autosoft. Looking to change to tandem x2 in summer.

Control IQ and bad CGM Readings,"Hello

So I am thinking about switching to X2 from Medtronic 640g and want to use Control IQ if I do.

However I am slightly concerned with CGM integration as with G7 (which is supported in future I know) just like G6 if my sensor is mis behaving and needs to be replaced but if it sends wrong low or high readings then is there danger of pump over or under delivering insulin?",https://www.reddit.com/r/TandemDiabetes/comments/12hhmm5/control_iq_and_bad_cgm_readings/,"['Dexcom is way more accurate then the Medtronic sensor,  the Medtronic I was always second guessing, now with the Dexcom I trust it.  Night and day difference in accuracy', ""I sometimes get inaccurate CGM readings sent to my Tandem. It almost always happens near the end of the 10 day sensor lifespan. I turn Control IQ off whenever the sensor is giving inaccurate readings.\n\nIt's just one of those things. I love the CGM integration and the options it affords, but the technology is still relatively new and not foolproof. I hope the G7 will be better about not failing towards the end of the sensor lifespan."", 'The Control IQ algorithm does a remarkable job, and the pros vastly outweigh the cons. Your mileage may (and almost certainly will!) vary, but the biggest issues in my experience with G6 sensors are compression lows, and the sensor trace being ragged i.e. readings jumping around as sensors start to fail. Compression lows will cause CIQ to reduce or stop basal, but you will learn the best places on your body to put sensors to avoid them. When the sensor recovers, basal will restart and often increase because of the apparent “fast” rise in BG. Same with sensor readings being ragged - particularly in sleep mode, the reductions in basal when the CGM reading is falsely dropping tend to be offset by increases in insulin when it is falsely rising. No system is perfect, but CIQ and Dex work more than well enough in closed loop that I have never lost trust in them.', ""I've used Dexcom since the G5 and I've rarely had calibration issues over 4 years.  Just got my Tandem on Friday and went live Saturday and despite ripping my insertion site out once and not knowing it, my numbers are so much better!!!"", 'thanks all', 'You can calibrate the sensor, or turn off control iq temporarily if needed. It hasnt been a huge issue for us, usually only the first day or so is iffy, but again husband will usually just calibrate it. A dew times we’ve had to pull a new sensor and replace it because it just refused to read correctly lol (usually it would read falsely LOW, and couldn’t get it to stop)', ""I've never had an issue where I was put in a dangerous position due to inaccurate readings. Yes, they are occasionally inaccurate, but I calibrate, and then it's fine. And if for some reason the sensor stops giving readings (like sensor error) the pump just reverts to preprogrammed settings."", ""Sometimes I do get bad readings, but you can calibrate on the pump and any other device you're using with the g6. But if for example you have no readings it will continue doing what it was last on, e.g if you were hypoing it would keep it at 0 delivery until you get the next one, and if you were high it would keep it at the higher basal rates.\n\nIts never really caused me an issue or rollercoastering though, despite going hours without readings on my last sensor. I dont switch CiQ during these times."", 'Our son was on medtronic for 4 years, and has been on CIQ for 2.5 years. We have more accuracy with the Dex than medtronic by a lot.It\'s just a case of ""if you feel things are off, check."" We very rarely have issues where the dex is reading so high compared to BG that is has much impact on insulin delivered. Maybe twice in the last 2.5 years and it\'s never caused a problem, we just check BG when the high doesn\'t make sense and then calibrate to fix. Both times it happened was when a brand new sensor first came online, so we simply check BG when the sensor pops on to see if it\'s ok. More often (but still not frequently) what happens is he has a bad low and it takes a while for Dex to catch up, so his Dex will read 50 when he\'s already 90. When that happens we just shut CIQ off and monitor until Dex catches up (usually not long) and then turn it back on. Unlike with automode where it\'s a headache to shut it on and off, with CIQ you just tap the button to shut it off, tap the button to turn it back on. That\'s it.

I definitely have more issues on startup with Dexcom but after calibrating twice it usually falls in line. Sometimes it does just want to read high for a full day. This worries me most because I am hypo unaware, so I tend to use my meter a lot on day 1. After that I check once every other day or so, more if one of those random fingerstick tests is far enough off from the Dexcom.  With Medtronic I was forced to test at least twice a day and they were always very close to my sensor readings.

I have some questions. Choosing between tandem and Omni pod.,"Hi everyone,

I am in the process with my Drs to get my first pump. I need to decide between the Omni pod or the tandem pumps. I am having difficulty deciding (probably because I overthink everything). I have some questions for those wearing the random pumps. I really like the idea of the tandem with the controls and user interface and how I can customize settings. However, my concern is dealing with the tubing. I am a bigger dude and have a habit of catching belt loops and pockets on doors and just about anything else you can think of. I am also a volunteer firefighter and so I am putting on weird bulky gear and strapping air packs to me and getting is tight places. I also do not like things hanging on me. I dont wear watches or jewelry or hats because they drive me nuts. So i am worried that the tubing will do the same.  


So now to my questions.  


1. If you are like me a bigger person how did you deal with the tubing getting caught on things or was it even a problem?
2. How do you deal with the pump and tubing when sleeping (I toss and turn a lot)?
3. For those who do similar activities like Firefighting or situations where you are in tight spaces or not-so-great conditions, how do you deal with it? (my thought is to disconnect and pause it then do corrections later)
4. Does anyone have creative ways for a man (not getting a fanny pack like my friend suggested) to hold and keep the pump out of the way?
5. Do you prefer the infusion set with the steel cannula if you do a lot of activities?
6. What is something you wish you had known before going with tandem?
7. And for those who had omni pod and switched to tandem. Why did you switch?",https://www.reddit.com/r/TandemDiabetes/comments/12el3p5/i_have_some_questions_choosing_between_tandem_and/,"['My 9 year old has the tSlim pump, so mileage may vary on the answers. \n\n1. She’s pretty small, but hasn’t ever got the tubing caught on anything. If the infusion site is on her arm, she runs the tube up her shirt. If it’s on her back or abdomen, she just tucks in the extra tube length to her pants or shirt. \n\n2. We worried about this, she has a tank top with a pocket that works really well for us. They make a lot of clothes specifically to hold pumps and keep tubing pretty tight. \n\n3. You could disconnect, but is running the tubing under clothes not an option for you? Or are you worried about the potential heat from a fire on the pump? \n\n4. I haven’t looked for men’s clothing, but I do know that people are making clothes that include pockets for pumps and slits for tubing. Maybe like a hand stitched undershirt or something?\n\n5. My daughter is pretty active and the auto soft 30 has been the best for us. She didn’t like the trusteel. \n\n6. I think we were hoping for better numbers with less involvement. We still manually bolus a lot. I also didn’t realize you can’t set up extended blouses from the mobile app', 'I’ve used tandem for years and switched to the OM5 and won’t go back. It is great for physical activity and I don’t have to worry about breaking a $3000 pump. \n\nGet the OM5 intro kit and if you don’t like it you can always switch to tandem. If you get the tandem first you’ll be stuck with it as generally they won’t pay for something else until years later.

I am 36 male, and was diagnosed at the age of 28. \n\nI used pens for 6 years, and there was no problems with my A1C… I’ve always been between 5.6 and 5.9. My endocrinologist always recommended to get on the pump, and I was very resistant. \n\nFirst and foremost, a pump is not required at all. It’s your choice.\n\nWhy do I continue to use the pump? Convenience and control over lows. \n\nI started with the 770G, and it’s like a dinosaur compared to the TSlim. My insurance changed, so I needed to switch pumps to control finances better. I was very worried about switching, but I’m glad I did. \n\nI can’t speak about personal use regarding omnipod, but my doctor highly recommended that I did not use it. Per my doctor, they have very poor support and very poor use. \n\nWith that being said, TSlim is literally a game changer in combination with Dexcom. There are some cons. \n\n-The Tslim isn’t completely waterproof like the 770G. The 770G is IPK8, and the Tslim is IPX7. In practical terms, that means don’t go swimming with it on. \n\n-The tslim is a chargeable non removable battery. I prefer 770G double A batteries that you can readily swap out. \n\nThe pros heavily outweigh the cons though…\n\nControl IQ and Basal IQ is such a game changer at this moment in time… basically no more more lows for me, and extremely good control. \n\nTo answer your questions:\n\n1. I’m 5’8’ and 180 lbs. I wouldn’t describe myself as a big guy. However, my tubing never gets caught. I don’t where my pump on the outside, and it always stays in my pocket. I cut a small hole in my right side pocket, and run my tubing through it and under my clothing to my site. \n\n2. I toss and turn too. However I barely notice because I order longer tubing. Do not order short tubing.\n\n3. I can’t speak to this at all. I would recommend disconnecting. One thing with the pump is that you can disconnect while still leaving in the infusion site. You can’t do that with omnipod. That may be a deal breaker for you. You would be wasting so many pods and so much insulin. \n\n4. See number 1. You can also bolus from your phone so you don’t have to grab the pump and operate. \n\n5. I don’t use steel infusion sets so I can’t give advice here. \n\n6. I was very resistant to change from my 770G. Medtronic is the big company out there, but their products have fallen way behind. I spent weeks trying to decide. Only thing I want is the new Mobi pump coming out that is waterproof and completely controlled by your phone. \n\n7. Can’t speak to this. \n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any questions hope I could help.', ""our son is 14, but he's very active  \n1. Rarely happens that the tubing gets caught. You will have choices for how long the tubing is and could try a box of different lengths to see what works for you. \n\n2. You, like we did, are probably over-thinking this. It's a nonissue. Our son uses a type 1 tactical (brand) holster and just clips the pump on his underwear. Sometimes he wakes up with the pump in his bed but that's rare and even so it's never caused issues. Lots of people sleep with their pump loose in their bed all the time. \n\n3. This is just my opinion and our experience after our son has been on this pump for 2 years, the system works best when you can work to avoid highs, especially big highs. So if you suspend you pump and disconnect even for a half hour, it's going to have an impact on your BG which make take longer to get under control. Even when the pump suspends insulin for a low for 30 minutes, it causes a rebound high. When he is doing something like swimming, we disconnect it but we check BG every 30 mins and then hook up and do corrections or just add insulin because he isn't getting the basal. Remember you won't have long-acting insulin to back you up, and as soon as you stop getting the fast-acting through the pump, the impact is pretty swift. But the pump is small and IMO shouldn't cause a huge issue being in the way. \n\n4. The holster works for our son. It's super solid and protects the pump and keeps it attached to his waistbelt really well. Nothing else needed. Our son's endo uses the same pump, and he cuts  a tiny hole in the bottom of his pants pockets to thread the tubing through which keeps it out of the way. \n\n5. We switched to the tru steel because we just had more issues with the other one. This was our son's choice, as he was tired of dealing with random bent cannulas (not frequent but annoying) and his BG was just more variable on the other infusion set. Tru steel is nice because it eliminates variables when you are troubleshooting an unexpected high BG. He also prefers the lack of an injecting mechanism like the autosoft uses. \n\n6. That sleep mode is amazing. He has been in sleep mode for the last year entirely and the only regret I have is that I was too afraid to try it before that. His TIR and A1C are fantastic for a 14 year old going through puberty and we couldn't be happier. He used 2 previous medtronic pumps and they did not work nearly as well for him as the tslim does."", 'Have never used onmipod but I can speak to my tslim experience\n\nI’m a bigger person too, 6’ tall and some extra fat, but hasn’t ever affected me catching the tubing on anything. Couple of things I’ve run into though: if you’re tall, get the 33” or 44” tubing. Having it in my pocket with the 22” tube when I have to go the the bathroom is a little awkward. If you have more fat, you might like the option of different cannula length. 6mm is fine for me. I use autosoft xc and have no problem with the cannula kinking because of fat rolls. (Only time I’ve ever had a site issue is because I didn’t insert properly.) \n\nI either tuck my pump into my bra or underwear to sleep (usually tight enough to keep it in place when I sleep but that might be different for you as a guy)\n\nI work in a screen printing warehouse, so conditions aren’t really optimum but better than firefighting conditions I suppose lol. I definitely bang it around a little no matter where it is on my body. I haven’t gotten around to getting a case for it yet, there are some good ones out there I’ve heard. I like that I can tuck it away and not have to adjust much on the pump during the day. I bolus through my phone, and I suspend insulin if I’m going low (although it usually does that for me) conditions are obviously harsher, but I can work in a non climate controlled warehouse in Texas and the insulin won’t denature. There are also tons of different profile configurations so you can fine tune things easily. I am particularly impressed with sleep mode; that will take a little more liberty with auto adjustments and ultimately takes away a lot of the overnight low anxiety when I don’t wake up for alarms lol \n\nMy endo suggested cutting or stitching a small button hole in the inside of my pants pockets to run the tubing through to keep it tucked away. \n\n5 and 6 I think I kind of answered up there but I haven’t had an issue with the autosoft kinking with a lot of activity. Definitely wish I would have known to get longer tubing if you’re taller lol\n\nSomeone else mentioned this, but one reason I didn’t go with omnipod is the larger footprint on your body. I have knocked a few Dexcoms off on doorframes and such, so my thinking was a smaller profile would help mitigate that risk.

The main one was I wanted tubing so that i KNOW i’m getting insulin instead of questioning if the bluetooth worked. most times I would leave it somewhere and I didn’t get insulin and I would normally be in 300-400’s and as a bigger person, I didn’t want to live like that. I am so glad I switched and the small things don’t compare to what I went through with omnipod (i’m not dissing them it’s just not for me)\n\n1: at first it may be hard and sometimes when your used it it, don’t be too hard on yourself. it’s normal to forget this tubing is on the side. surprisingly didn’t happen as much just remember to tuck in the tubing in pants!\n2: i’m the same way, make sure your pump is clipped onto anything like pants/underwear/even shirts or sometimes it will rip out, but sometimes you can’t be mad at yourself that it ripped out. learned the hard way\n4: pockets and just clipping to the top/strap of pants?\n6: I wish I knew it was a little bit longer process to change a set than omnipod, your first few weeks plan on 10-20 minutes of just using muscle memory and double checking each step. also some alarms don’t turn off at all, count this as a warning 😅\n7: answered in the beginning \n\nAlso I don’t know why this happens but for me no adhesive help (such as alcohol swaps, liquid prep, etc) makes my site more likely to rip out. it may be different for you!\n\nhope this helps, PM me if you have any other questions! hoping you are glad with your decision!', 'Hello\n\nI never used Omnipod and honestly I use about 90 units per day so the 200 unit capacity is an issue for me.\n\nI use the t:slim and always wear a band from Revel under my clothes and when I sleep it is comfortable and have no issues wearing the pump anytime.\n\nI started with holster and it was a pain when going to bathroom and sleeping \n\nHere is link to the band I use and love;\n\nhttps://revelwear.com/products/universal-activewear-band-with-insulin-pump-pocket\n\nThe tubing threads through a hole in back so no tubing hangs out and again it is comfortable to wear and most important discrete.

I guess I might be considered a big buy, but it's all relative. I'm 6', 240lbs. I get it caught on door knobs and sometimes on the seat adjuster in my car. But it is VERY rare when this happens. Usually when I have my infusion set on my side, and my pump in a lower side pocket (like on carpenter shorts).\n2. I keep my pump slipped to my shorts. I don't use the Tandem provided case (as the clip dug into my side). I bought a Type 1 Tactical case/holster. When I roll over, I just sort of instinctively grab my pump and move it the other side. I NEVER sleep on my back, so most time I just clip it to the back of my shorts and don't have to deal with it.\n3. I just tuck the excess tubing into my waistline, and put my pump inside my pocket. I usually buy pants and shorts that are carpenter (that have lower side pockets on both sides. I clip the front of the pump face towards my leg, so the clip is the only thing exposed. Yes, tubing runs externally down my leg, but I usually keep it taut.\n4. It's becoming more common to find clothing that has extra pockets or compartments. Usually these are provided for cell phones (tech pockets), but work great for pumps as well. Other option include getting an arm or leg band that is usually used by runners to hold their phone. A stretchy spandex type material.\n5. I use the XC. My wife uses the XC. My daughter uses a Medtronic Mio Advanced infusion set with the XC tubing. She was constantly having bent cannulas, and had better success with Medtronic Mio Advanced, and we discovered that it has the same infusion side connector as the XC. Took some effort, but insurance covers both brands.\n6. That the infusion sets suck. Really wished Tandem made a Mio Advanced type set (or even the Mio Extended).

I found that as I gained weight the omnipod became much more uncomfortable. The cannula in the omnpod is always the same size, whereas with the tubed pump you can choose bigger sizes if you have more fat where you will be inserting the pump, by the end my omnipods were leaking almost constantly because the cannula tube was too short for my body\n\nI have not had a whole lot of issues with tubing getting caught, I get wrapped around a door handle once in a while but it has never been bad enough to pull out a site or be more than a moment of frustration.  It’s not pleasant, but I also caught my omnipod on things as well, it happened less often but it was much worse when it did.\n\nI could also feel the pod a lot more on my body than I can the tube, when the pod is stuck to you it bounces with your body as you move, and if I had it on my arms or legs I could feel it bounce with every step because it was heavier.

T1 New Yorkers with NY State of health/ mainstream managed care question.,"Hi, have an appt with endo for April 11 but until then...

As of April 1 2023, NY State of Health Medicaid managed care has switched from filling my CGM (and pump supplies prior to that date) thru my health plan to the NYRx pharmacy program at my regular pharmacy. The problem is that my normal pharmacy, local Walgreens, local Walmart-- every single place I've called can't/don't (won't?) fill them. It first started with pump supplies last year as that switched to NYRx first. I haven't received pump supplies since then, because of the switch. Called all local pharmacies and no luck. 

CGM switch to NYRx is effective as stated on April 1, so after I run out, that is all I have unless I find a pharmacy. The pharmacy I use for my insulin and other bottled monthly meds said they don't even show the Tandem Xslim pump in their system to even order pump supplies for. So I'm just at a loss. 

Is anyone else in NY having a hard time filling their supplies? And if you have had any success, what did you do? I'm hoping my endo will be able to help but since I haven't gotten any pump supplies in almost a year, I figured I'd appeal to the masses. (I did notify my endo last year when the first change happened and it affected my supplies, nothing ever came of it). 

I know we have to be pretty resourceful out of necessity more often than not, so I've been reusing what I can, but I mean...I have insurance so I shouldn't have to do that.

"When putting the insulin in the cartridge, it is nearly impossible to push. Why is this?","So I load up my syringe with insulin.

Correction factor when below target,"Hello all, I hope somebody can help me understand this. Sometimes when using Control-IQ the pump corrects me into a low, so I raised the correction factor. The strange thing I found is that this works in the opposite direction when trying to bolus when below target. A higher correction factor gives me less insulin when above target (which is good because of the lows), but more insulin when below target. Am I getting this right? Does anyone else struggle with this?

In general, I found I have to set correction factors way higher on the Tandem pump than my old Medtronic, I guess because of the basal modulation. Is this normal? How do you handle correction factors while on Control-IQ? 

Thanks!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/TandemDiabetes/comments/128l4sa/correction_factor_when_below_target/,"[""We run our son's pump in sleep mode 24/7 because we couldn't get the correction factors to work right for him. Ever since he was diagnosed (12 years ago so not a honeymooning issue), his sensitivity for correction factors for a lower BG versus a really high one changes how it works for him. It was the same on MDI, on the Medtronic pumps and on Tandem. His correction factor works exactly like it should if his BG is under 250 or so. Whether CIQ does autocorrections or we do them, the correction brings him into range. However, when he gets really high, 300+, the correction factor is too strong and he goes low when he shouldn't. So he runs in sleep mode which we find works better for him because it's more aggressive with basal increases immediately as BG increases rather than waiting to give an autocorrection until he's already going high (and then only giving them hourly after that). Even though the calculation is designed to prevent stacking, he still goes low from autocorrections if he's too high or is high for hours. Sleep mode doesn't do autocorrections at all, so if he goes way high and won't come down, we have to add corrections in (since the basal can only increase within a range of the settings). Basically, we have found that the best way to avoid a low due to overcorrecting is to help ensure there aren't big highs and sleep mode does better with that for our son than normal CIQ did."", 'I am fairly new to this pump and my Dr told me not to do the correction factor as the Control-IQ was already doing it in the background.

If you are high, a higher correction factor will lead to a recommendation of less insulin for a given BG than a lower correction factor. Similarly, if you are below target, the reduction in the recommended dose based on the amount your BG is below target, will also be smaller. \n\nFor example, let’s start with a correction factor of 1U changes BG by 40 mg/dL (sorry, in the U.S.). A) If you are 40 pts high, you would need 1U. B) Similarly if you are at your target, and have 1U of insulin on board and haven’t eaten anything, your BG could fall to 40pts below your target assuming your basal is correct and not being modulated. C) If you are 40pts below your target, that is equal to having to withhold 1U.\n\nNow  consider what the recommendation would be if your correction factor is 1U changes BG by 80 mg/dL, i.e. you are more insulin sensitive. For A), your would need 0.50U. For B), your BG could fall by 80pts. For C), 40pts low would be equal to having to withhold 0.50U. If you think about it in terms of insulin sensitivity, it makes sense - it takes less of a change in insulin to have a given impact on your BG. \n\nAnother tip is always take into account your insulin on board and the rate of change of your BG, whenever making dosing decisions. Even when using Control IQ, the pump has a way to calculate insulin on board.', ""If the pump is recommended a correction with a food bolus, that is because it's calculated that it is needed (it has calculated what it already gave you for autocorrections). It can only give autocorrections within a range of your settings and only gives 60% of a correction. So when you bolus, it's offering the amount that the autocorrection couldn't cover. It could be the stacking that causes the low but your settings might need adjusting as well."", 'Thanks! I agree that in terms of insulin sensitivity it makes sense. It just seems counterintuitive at first.']"

In general, less damage to the nerves makes recovery better. Talk to your doctor (preferably neurologist, but your endo might know) about the possibility of recovering nerve function. In general a good A1c will slow additional damage and can allow the body to recover. If you have fully lost sensation to part of the body or have neuropathy over a large area of the body (ie arms and legs) then you will not likely experience significant improvement, unfortunately. The less time your A1c has been high (and the lower the peak A1c), the less total damage you likely have (months vs years of time damage has been done) and the more likely recovery is. Unfortunately neuropathy can also happen for reasons beyond diabetes (car accident, sports injury, autoimmune condition (chronic inflammatory Demylenating Polyneuropathy - CIDP), etc) so it is hard to know exactly what is going on in the body without looking at nerve conduction studies (NCV/NSC), A1c tests, and other diagnostic tools. Your doctor can best answer your odds of improvement, though even then its odds (like a 60% chance) not a certainty. Even major damage with slim odds can improve, while sometimes minor damage with great odds of improvement doesn't. There are also medications they can use to treat neuropathy symptoms. Medications like gabapentin, lyrica, Cymbalta, and a few others work well for many patients, reducing itchiness, tingling, and pain associated with nerve damage.

Tandem Is Losing Its Way,"RANT:

This is what bugs me. They sold this pump to me on the idea I would receive updates. NO WHERE in the material for sales did it state *only upgradable for 5 years.*

Conserving insulin?,"Hi all,
As you know sometimes we need to change our set when there is still insulin left in the cartridge.  Since it costs as much as a used car I was wondering if anyone ever sucks the leftover insulin out of the used cartridge to use in the next set change.  I’ve never done it but I’m tired of wasting so much between priming to get rid of bubbles and needing to change it when there is leftover insulin.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TandemDiabetes/comments/11s0sld/conserving_insulin/,"[""I always pull the insulin out of the cartridge. As long as it hasn't been out of the fridge longer than a few weeks you should be fine."", 'I always change set and cartridge independently.

It's never been a problem."", 'I tend to change mine every 3.5-4 days and my insulin runs out by then. My current issue isn’t the insulin, but getting my insurance to cover all the pump supplies.', ""I always suck the remaining insulin out, or wait until there's zero units to change it. The alarms do get annoying, so I keep mine on low or vibrate. But yes you absolutely can! It does get super bubbly so be prepared to spend time flicking the syringe lol."", 'With the understanding that it\'s not ideal and to keep a closer eye on BG, yes. We do this with our son. We change cartridge and infusion on the same day because he\'s 14 so keeping up with yet another thing to remember gets to be a lot for his age. But if he\'s running short we\'ll add 50 units to get to the next day. And if he has too much, we\'ll pull out the excess. But generally only if there is quite a bit (like more than 20 units). We avoid doing it when it\'s hot though, heat causes insulin to degrade faster and the pump already runs warmer than the other pumps out there. So if it\'s an 85 degree week in July and he\'s been outside a lot we won\'t reuse that insulin. Or if he\'s seeing high BG and we need to change everything out, we don\'t reuse the insulin just in case it\'s the cause of the high BG.   \n\n\nIf you remove the bubbles well when you prime the cartridge you shouldn\'t have many. I honestly can\'t think of a time we\'ve had bubbles in the tubing ever. Remove the air before you fill the cartridge. and never disconnect it at the ""pigtail"" connection between the cartridge and the site.', ""You need to figure out how much insulin you use in the time period that you want to wear the infusion set.  For example, I aim for 3.5-4 days between changes.  I average between 30-35 units a day TDD.  Counting the \\~45 units wasted/overhead with the T:slim, that means I fill my reservoir with \\~165 units.  That leaves me with \\~120-125 units available for use, which lands me right where I want to be for changes.

The only time I struggled to afford insulin at all was when I was in grad school on the crappy student insurance plan and blew through my Rx lifetime maximum in a single semester. Thankfully, the ACA had recently passed and there was a federal high risk pool…that you had to be uninsured for six months to qualify for. Thank goodness for the new world we live in!\n\nSo yeah, even before the ACA but certainly after, copays for insulin in the commercial market are not expensive for the vast, vast majority of insurance plans. I also have the crappiest policy I have had since the ACA passed, and I picked up enough insulin last month to last me until the fall. It cost $60 out of pocket. \n\nI get that the some insulins have higher cost sharing than others, but there is ALWAYS a therapeutically equivalent insulin on the lowest branded cost sharing their for whatever someone might be on with a process in place to get the other product covered at the lower cost if there are sufficient medical reasons to justify it. \n\nSorry for my rant. I just hate seeing diabetics go to extreme or really any measure to pinch pennies around insulin when they shouldn’t have to.', 'Thanks', 'Interesting.  I’ve never done that but it hardly seems worth it for 20 or 30 units.  I would have to change the cartridge the next day.', 'Do you always change your set every 3 days, or let it go longer?', 'That’s funny because that was another concern I had.  I lose so much insulin priming it’s ridiculous.', 'Thank you, excellent advice.  So you remove air from the cartridge before putting the insulin in?  I don’t remember learning that but it’s great advice and everything you said makes perfect sense.', 'I do try to do that but some days I just don’t end up eating carbs (or eating) and other days, I need to change out early for an early morning appointment so it’s not perfect.  I ran into that today and it got me thinking.  It wouldn’t be a regular thing but wasting insulin with the cost is upsetting.', 'You could also fill it up again. You talk about taking insulin out, why not “top it off” and change the site?', 'It makes more sense than pulling the unused insulin out, potentially contaminating it, and reinserting in a new cartridge. 🤷\u200d♀️\n\nIf I change a site without changing cartridge, I save the unused tubing to attach to the new cartridge when I’m ready to do that. I typically change a cartridge every 5 days or so, but change sites every 3.', 'Always every 3 days. I don’t want to risk scar tissue, I hope to be a pumper for a very long time.', 'Oh absolutely! It is pretty ridiculous and wasted insulin is annoying. Sucking the insulin out helps with that. The mixing is fine.', ""Yep! What we do is fill up the syringe with insulin first with however much he uses in 3 days plus a bit extra for a buffer. Then put the needle into the fill hole on the cartridge and pull the air out. That's how we were taught to do it in training, I like that you get a visual for the air bubbles coming into the syringe insulin so you can see it (if that makes sense). Pull the needle out, give it a flick to bring the bubbles to the top and they squirt the air out. Then fill the cartridge. I think Tandem has a YouTube video that shows it too if my description doesn't make sense 😂"", ""Yes, the amounts we use can vary from day to day(ex: I only used a little over 25 u's TDD yesterday).  But on average, it usually works out.  Occasionally, I do have to change out before I want to, because of work or travel, because I'll possibly run out or be really close, before I'll be in a position to change, but that's not a regular thing.\n\nI'm fortunate that I have good insurance and a nice stockpile of insulin, but I do not like wasting it either, as there are people who don't have enough and are forced to ration theirs or even go without.  So I treat mine with respect and appreciate what I do have."", 'I didn’t think we were supposed to do that and I would be afraid it would leak.  You bring up an excellent point though as to why the cartridge isn’t made in such a way that you could do that.  So much plastic waste.  I would rather have a pump with regular batteries and a cartridge that is good for ten days.', 'This is exactly what I do (site every 3ish, cartridge every 5ish). I almost never change them at the same time.', 'I will look for that video!  That will save some insulin with priming for sure.  I may have learned it but forgot😂', 'Amen', 'I do it often when I know I’m not in a good place to change a site or need to stretch a site another day for whatever reason. Take it out and put 50-70 units in and it works just fine in my experience. I’ve also topped off a cartridge from 150 to the full amount when a canula bent and had only had the site for 2 days. Just changed the site, and topped off cartridge it was good to go until the end of the next site. I’ve never had an issue reusing carteidges. Reminder, not a doctor and don’t work for tandem. Take my opinion for just that, my opinion/experience. Cheers', 'Thanks for that.  I use the steel set, so no bent cannulas but it’s good to know people are doing these things successfully.']"

Depending on where I've inserted it, it will stop working if I roll over on it in my sleep. They'll also stop working if I tug on the tubing accidentally, before taping them down. I find them all finicky. I use different sets for different locations, and they can all be problematic."", ""Don't push down on the inserter when you are inserting it if you are using the autosoft.

Wait a couple of seconds, push down a bit on the middle white part so that the adhesive fully sticks, and then pull straight off/out. \n\nWe switched to tru steel because of the uncertainty of the autosoft cannulas. We had the same issue with the medtronic version where they randomly caused bent cannulas, including a 4 day ICU stay due to DKA. Also, make sure you check the tubing for bubbles, make sure you fill the cannula. And don't let an unexpected high go for too long. If it doesn't start to come down, re-do the infusion and do a small injection and either shut CIQ off temporarily or monitor closely."", 'My understanding is that pushing down is simply to help the adhesive take hold, before pulling on the needle.

Switching from 770G,Looking to switch from Medtronic 770G looking for pros and cons from others that made this switch.,https://www.reddit.com/r/TandemDiabetes/comments/11nyp7w/switching_from_770g/,"[""When I switched from the 670G to the 770G, I was hopeful for all of the claims that the sensor was going to be so much better to be true and I was very disappointed that I did not see any significant difference. At that point, I just stopped wearing the sensor altogether. I started doing research and saw great reviews of Tandem's Control IQ. I decided to switch systems and within my first 3 months on Control IQ, my A1C dropped almost 2 percentage points. I am so happy I made the switch. \n\n2 downsides for me:\n\n1) You have to fill the tubing with a minimum of 10 units of insulin so there is some waste there but I don't mind that if in return if the system gives me better A1Cs and time in range. \n\n2) The Tslim is a chargeable pump - so just a learning curve to remember to charge it as opposed to having a battery-operated pump. I usually just charge it every night while I'm watching TV. If I forget, not a big deal since the battery lasts pretty long and I've never gotten to below 50% before realizing I had forgotten to charge it for a few days."", 'Our son switched from the 670g to the tslim/CIQ 2 years ago and we have zero regrets. The ONLY thing I miss about Medtronic is the reservoir and its fill process and accuracy.

And there are no issues if you turn off ciq or issues with it ""learning"" so that if you are sick or run high for a week it doesn\'t then run you low for a week because it uses the last 6 days of insulin use to adjust. He did ok on Medtronic, we didn\'t hate it. But we\'re all much happier with the Tandem/Dex combo. Dexcom just works without issue. We were always messing around with the Medtronic sensors and having to baby sit them on change day and time it exactly right otherwise it would be offline for hours. Dex does its job.

My A1C ranges between 5.6 and 5.8, consistently, for years whether I use a pens or pump. The reason I like the pump is because it blocks lows better while I'm sleeping and prevents slightly elevated highs. I always KNOW and wake up when I have lows, and it's quite annoying. Sometimes on the verge of life threating.\n\n770G PROS\n\n* The Guardian 3 is obviously a crappy product. It requires 2 calibrations per day, and around 4 calibrations at startup. I don't use AUTO mode on my 770G. However, I do use auto stop and start though (takes my low target, and stops basal or bolus prior to BG from CGM). This is great at preventing the lows. After the first 3 calibrations, I always just type in my BG displayed instead of calibrating more.

The only thing that is better and more convenient for a diabetic is the Dexcom G7.\n* Can bolus from phone.\n* Slimmer design, less noticeable in pocket.\n* Can view my blood sugars on my Apple Watch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn my opinion, most of the T:SLIM X2 satisfaction that users experience comes directly from G6 and control IQ. If you toss that aside, I think the 770G comes out on top.\n\nTo me it's coming down to the finger prick frequency (4 times in 7 days for me, yes, I'm cheating) or the infusion site frequency on the T:Slim (every 3 days). I refuse to use the 120 target on the 770G, that's just absurdly high. I think the T:SLIM is also high at 110 on target.

Don’t worry, it’s not a problem. I charge every couple of days while showering.  As far as filling the tubing, you also have to fill the Medtronic tubing, so not much difference there.

How often does the extended portion of the bolus drip insulin? 
For some reason I thought it was every 5 minutes like basal (I think) but after testing extended boluses out a few times it seems like a larger portion hits me at the end. 
It's making me wonder if it's just two hits of insulin total?? One up front and the rest at the end of the timer... If so that kind of sucks actually

New to Tslim from Medtronic. Using a LOT more insulin.,"I just switched from the Medtronic 770G to the Tslim X2.  
It looks like I am using a lot more insulin through the Tslim than I used through my 770g.

My TDD on the Medtronic pump was about 31 units.  In the first week of the TSlim, I've been averaging 48-50 units.  I am using the Control IQ and used the Auto mode on the Medtronic pump so I would have thought they would be similar.  

Any thoughts on why this might be??

Also, this Tslim seems to waste a ton of insulin!  I filled my new cartridge with 200 units this morning, and I'm already down to 135 after some loading issues, tubing fill, and the 20 units that are unusable.  That's super frustrating.

T-Slim X2 Control-IQ and Gastroparesis,"I've been on the T-Slim for about 2 years. During this time, my insulin usage has increased and my moderately severe gastroparesis has gotten worse. After reviewing my recent usage, my dr. told me to set my TDD to 120 and to use square wave boluses of 3-5 hours.

The X2 will only let me enter up to 100 for TDD and 2 hours for square wave. The problem is, control-IQ will not keep up with my blood sugars if I only take a 2 hour square and taking a full meal bolus over 2 hours will absolutely drive me super low, followed by super high later. But depending on Control-IQ for that longer digestion period as my Tandem educator suggested has me at over 300 for half the day along with over 30 units a day of manual correction boluses. The only thing I've found to help is extremely vigorous exercise which, while good for me, is not practical to do 3-4 times a day.

Does anyone have any experience with this that they can share, or other suggestions to get Control-IQ to be a LOT LOT LOT more aggressive? 120 units a day and I'm still seeing over 300 for 10hrs/day!",https://www.reddit.com/r/TandemDiabetes/comments/11eq89k/tslim_x2_controliq_and_gastroparesis/,"[""This may sound silly, but chewing gum immediately after a meal speeds up digestion for me. I've also talked to my doctor about trialing regular insulin in the pump. She okayed that, and I have some, but I've been too afraid to try. Are you bolusing after the meal?\n\nIf you're over 300 a lot of the day, I'd try some basal testing. You can't set tdd over 100, but starting with correct basal programming goes a long way with CIQ. \n\nThere are rumors tandem is going to release an update to CIQ that will liberalize some of the settings."", ""Some time ago, I was on a (very) large dose of prednisone.  Naturally, during, my insulin requirements went through the god damned roof.  \n\nThe best fix I found was to adjust my _basal_ rates more than anything.   I took my normal values and just multiplied everything by 2.5 and set it as a whole new profile.  \n\nNormally, the basal adjustment part of the pump was running under the max, but it was still WAY more insulin than normal.  It took a bit of tweaking, and I was prone to some rebounds, because it's kind of a hack, but it kept me under 200 most of the time, which, if you've ever done prednisone, was a miracle.  \n\nAlong the same vein, if this is a long-term problem, your doctor might be receptive to adjusting your therapy to include a daily basal or long-acting insulin on top of pump therapy.  That's a bit more dangerous and difficult to control, but it could help."", ""Thanks for the suggestions. I'll definitely try some basal adjustments. It seems that although my Tandem educator explicitly told me that none of my basal settings matter at all if I have Control-IQ active, that really doesn't seem to be the case. (unless the transmitter is out of range like, you know, more than 8 inches away lol)"", ""You might be better off just turning off CIQ during the day and using extended bolus without it, which should let you increase the time. I believe the 2 hour limit is only when CIQ is turned off (but you'd want to check on that). Any time we use extended bolus we have to do more insulin later, it's just not enough for slow digestion. Our son doesn't has gastro. but I mean for really heavy or dense meals. Some take 10 hours to fully digest and we give numerous additional boluses starting about 2 hours after eating (after the extended wore off) and we only do a portion of the carbs up front. We did this with fast food last week, it was 210g and we did only 120g up front with a 70% extend which kept him in the low 100s until he started to go up. Then we gave more boluses 2, 4 and 6 hours after the meal. We are still tweaking but it kept him just over 200 instead of 300+. I realize your issue isn't the same cause, just explaining something that might help.\n\nIf you need to stay in CIQ, then it might be more helpful just to set alarms to do more insulin due to the slow digestion. You could do multiple extended boluses, for example (each time the previous one expires) or just set reminders to add more insulin. \n\nYou also might benefit from keeping a log, as certain foods obviously can make matters much harder to deal with. As you find what works, keep adjusting. \n\nI do know some people who tighten their range with CIQ by changing the weight setting, but I'd be cautious with that until you know what impact it has. CIQ is really intended to help avoid lows and is less efficient at managing highs once they start because it can only increase within a range and can't know the details. We did find sleep mode 24/7 works way better for our son because it is more aggressive on highs immediately. Whereas in normal mode we found that it would start to treat a high too late and then he'd take hours to come down."", 'Try 24/7 sleep mode, as it’s much more aggressive than CIQ(it only corrects with basal adjustments. no auto-correction bolus) and, although kind of a pain, do multiple combo/extended boluses(reduce the total bolus amount and run it for the 2 hrs, then repeat).', ""Your basal rates definitely matter.  When your sensor readings are in range, that's what CIQ uses.  When not in range it adjusts your rates up/down.  Medtronic and Omnipod ignore your own rates but Tandem doesn't."", 'That is scary as hell that the Tandem educator told you that, as your basal rate most certainly does matter.  If they work for Tandem, I would call Tandem and report them.  If they work for your endo/doctors office, then report them to them.  They have no business teaching people how to use a device/system(that can kill them) that they obviously don’t know the first thing about. \n\nI’ve been on pumps since 2008 and the effectiveness of CIQ is very dependent on getting your basal rate dialed in, as closely as possible.']"

Gained weight since starting pump therapy?,"I just want to know if anyone else has this problem? Since I started my pump last year, I’ve gained weight. A lot of weight when before that I could lose weight no problem?

This is a stock answer.\n\nEverything we do to control our blood sugar makes us fat.\n\nInsulin to bring BG down, causes fat.\n\nSugar to raise BG, causes fat.\n\nSo, the only thing we can do to control our weight is the same thing everyone else does, and control our carb intake and exercise our asses off.\n\nIt just that when we have to eat carbs, that has to count toward our daily limit or we have to exercise a little bit extra.\n\nThis is how it is.

Reduce the extended highs that take more insulin to bring down. Reduce lows that take carbs to bring up. In addition to that, watch your diet and exercise. I wish there was a magic pill.

Dexcom G6 with tslim x2 pairing issue,"Hi All -

I’m 3 days into my latest G6 sensor, the little plastic thing has been active for like a month. The G6 is paired to my iPhone and Tandem pump only. Today my phone died, when it turned back on the dexcom connected right away, but when it did it seems to have killed the connection from the G6 to my pump. My pump keeps giving me the unable to find transmitter error. I’ve cleared the ID and re-entered it in my pump but that doesn’t work. Tried disabling Bluetooth on my phone and repairing the pump as well but no luck.  

Anyone ever had this issue and know the solution?",https://www.reddit.com/r/TandemDiabetes/comments/11czw1t/dexcom_g6_with_tslim_x2_pairing_issue/,"['The tslim has to be the primary device and your phone should be secondary. If it’s not then that may be the issues. As normally your phone’s connection to the Dexcom shouldn’t impact how your tslim is communicating with the Dexcom.', 'Contact customer support.', ""I would try this -\n\n1. remove the transmitter from your paired devices in your bluetooth settings on your phone\n2. remove it from your pump\n3. pair it back with your pump first\n4. pair it back with your phone\n\nIf that doesn't work, I would start by calling Tandem support as I've found they're easier to get to than Dexcom. They'll refer you to Dexcom if they think it's a problem with the transmitter, but it doesn't sound like it, since the transmitter and phone can talk to each other fine."", ""I feel bad I can'thelp. I've had no trouble with a transmitter luckily. I also start a new sensor and transmitter on both devices at the same time. Even when I forget to do it on my phone (only during the warm up period), I enter it and it matches the TSlim warm up time. I can't wait for the G7. Transmitter and Sensor in one, ftw. 30 minutes warm up time, yes please. Lol""]"

Weird X2 battery issue.,"Plugged my pump in last night to charge, and battery was at 85%. Heard it beeping while in the shower, and when I got out it was at 20% and displaying a power source alert. Tried different cables and chargers and nothing worked, even restarted it. Nothing would charge it. Finally after about a half hour of messing with it, the battery went back to 100% and was fine. Anyone else run into this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/TandemDiabetes/comments/11bwt7f/weird_x2_battery_issue/,"['I’ve had this happen once about three months into owning mine, I’m now three years on it without another problem……', 'Yeah this is scary.

I've had the Tandam tslim for around 6 months...,"It's my first pump and worked wonders for me. My A1c was almost always in the teens (my fault among other things) for almost 20 years. I got the Dexcom G6 and never could get below 9% A1c at that point. For some reason, even with long and ultra long acting insulin always spiked randomly throughout the day to hover over 200 and I would have to take 1 or 2 units just to bring it back down to normal. It didn't matter what dosages I was taking of the long acting. So after 3 months of G6, Tslim is introduced.

To be clear though, the Tslim and Dexcom G6 combined is perfect together for me. The Control IQ stops the roller coaster from experiencing lows and say my blood sugar does exceed 180-200, Control IQ brings it back to normal range gradually. 

First 3 months 9% A1c to 6.4%. After 3 more months, 6.4% to 5.5%. My endocrinologist was afraid of me experiencing severe Hypo so she changed the insulin ratio but I'm hoping my next visit will still have below 7% A1c and I'll be satisfied with these results for the rest of my life.

It's not perfect as I have issues with the supplies of the G6 and Tslim sometimes. I know not everyone has the same results but I couldn't help but express my satisfaction.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TandemDiabetes/comments/11avgev/ive_had_the_tandam_tslim_for_around_6_months/,"['I feel very similar as you and have nothing but gratitude for the combination of the two.
