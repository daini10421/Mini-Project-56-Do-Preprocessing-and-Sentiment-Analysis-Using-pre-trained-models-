2023 Community feedback loop results,"Hi members of r/diabetes 👋

**TL;DR**
We got some feedback from the community. Overall responses were positive but we also have some points where we can improve.
**/TL;DR**

A while ago, we joined the Reddit Feedback Loop initiative in an attempt to learn more about what you think about the community and our moderation of it. For this, Reddit selected a bunch of people who’ve visited the community or have done so in the past and invited them to fill out a survey.

The pool of invited participants was very varied and included daily participants as well as lurkers, and even users who had previously been banned.

Questions ranged from rating the community on a scale from “very dissatisfied” - “very satisfied” to open-ended questions where the participant could provide detailed feedback about their experience here. Of course, Reddit anonymized all the responses and removed harassing content before sending it our way.

I’m happy to report that Reddit has had to remove not a single response for being harmful or harassing <3.

In this post, I’d like to present some positive stats, some points where we could improve, and respond to a few specific answers.

## Positive stats 

Let’s start off with some statistics that we’re happy with!

- 79% of respondents are satisfied with our community. 
- 69% of respondents agree that our community helps them fulfil their needs.
- 85% of respondents agree that the rules are clear and easy to understand.
- 79% of respondents trust that we make decisions that benefit the community.
- 91% of respondents feel that people generally behave appropriately.
- Nobody reported that they feel unsafe in our community.

## Points of improvement

- Many of the respondents report seeing a lot of medical questions.
- Some respondents think the posts are messy and could do with some additional filtering.
- 7% of respondents report seeing harmful content more than once per week.

## Specific responses

I’d like to specifically respond to several concerns or remarks we got.

###Too much mixing of type 1 and type 2 (and similar concerns)

I’m sorry you feel that the distinction between type 1 and type 2 is unclear. We’ve made efforts to clear this up by letting people select their own flair and also adding flairs to posts. However, some of the respondents say that they want us to pick a type and only allow that here.

We will not exclude any diabetic from this community. There already exist type-specific subreddits which are great places for such discussions. We believe that the shared experience of diabetes also deserves a place.

###I still see a lot of posts that break the “No asking for a diagnosis” rule

Unfortunately, many people who are anxious about their health don’t take the time to read our rules before posting. We try to remove these posts as soon as we see them, and have recently expanded the moderation team to help with this.

The best way to help us deal with rule-breaking posts is always using the report button. This makes a post show up in our moderation tools so we can quickly respond.

###We need more moderators

We’ve recently added two new moderators to the team and now have better coverage in different timezones. Hopefully this has already addressed the issue.

###The theme could be polished

Please [message us](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/diabetes) if you want to help out.

###Please get rid of political content

⚠️opinion alert⚠️ there shouldn’t be a need to discuss diabetes-related politics because diabetes care shouldn’t be a political subject. 

Unfortunately, politics can have large effects on diabetes care. I can recall a (somewhat) recent example [about the $35 insulin bill](https://reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/wjvt6e/mega_thread_35_insulin_bill/). This was the first time we had to deal with such a large political discussion in our subreddit and honestly I don’t think we handled it very well.

However, simply banning all political discussions doesn’t help promote a fair and honest discussion of very important topics. Some people use Reddit to get their news, and something this important shouldn’t be hidden.

In the future, I believe that we should continue to allow political discussions so long as everyone remains civil. We’re not here to moderate what people believe or how they vote, only how they talk to others.

### Please add a “Vent” or “Rant” tag so I can filter it out

I can’t believe we hadn’t thought of this before. I’ve added the tag now :)

There were a lot of requests for very specific flairs. If you believe that we’re missing an important flair, please let us know in the comments here or by [messaging the moderators](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/diabetes).

### Please moderate people blaming type two’s for their condition better

It sucks that people still believe that T2’s have done this to themselves. It’s against the rules of our community and we remove any such posts. 
If you see someone who does blame anyone for their condition, please report the post so that we can remove it.

## That's it!

That's it for our response :) If you brought something up in the survey that I didn't mention, please know that we did look through the responses!

I have a Dexcom G6 but I felt weird and suspected my blood sugar was high and that I had ketones even though my Dexcom said 7.4, so I took out my testing kit from my cross-body bag and tested my blood sugar.

I have a phobia of blood and looking at that makes me feel faint, have some decency”. I explained to her that I am diabetic and felt weird and couldn’t wait until my next break (which was in two hours), I continued to explain that I am sorry and did not see her coming and that if I did, I would have waited until I had served her. She started to explain how the only reason I had to do that was because of my unhealthy habits and that kids these days (I am a 18yo female) need to start taking care of themselves more. I started to explain that I am type one diabetic and that T1D is not caused due to unhealthy lifestyle, she then cut me off and said “Look, I know you’re passionate about this or whatever, but I really don’t care and your manager will be told about your rudeness”.

Will my doctor ever stop telling me to lose weight?,"I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes a little over two years ago. A year and a half ago my A1C was 5.5. A month ago it was 4.9. My BG is 78-82 while fasting and around 120 an hour after eating. My resting heart rate has gone from 78 bpm average to 54 bpm average. Light exercise/walking puts me around 95 bpm. I can easily walk 5 miles. I’m much stronger and my endurance has gone way up. I’m fitter than ever, but I have lost minimal weight. I eat better than all my thin friends and am wayyyy more active. I spend almost all day every day outside doing labor landscaping. I can see how my body has changed with gaining muscle. I still weigh 225. My doctor even asked if I was lying about my diet/exercise before seeing my labs. After he saw my labs he said “if this was our first time meeting I’d give you a clean bill of health and send you on your way. But it’s not. You still need to loose about 80 lbs.” they put me on trulicity for weightloss for like a year and nothing happened. Now I’m on ozempic with no changes. The only time I lost weight was when insurance decided not to cover my atypical antipsychotics anymore and I lost about 20 lbs in 3 months without trying but also I literally went insane. The weight loss stopped as soon as I got back on my medication. I don’t know how to lose weight and my doctor is like “have you considered only eating 800 calories a day?” No I haven’t. I do manual labor. Outside. In 100+ heat.

I went from being 355 lbs to 225.  Then got misdiagnosed as T2. At that time my cholesterol was 275 and my triglycerides were 800 due to uncontrolled blood sugar.  Put me on Ozempic and Jardiance.  I’m really T1 so that sent me into DKA.  Lost 25 lbs in a week.  \n\nA month later, I’m at 205 and my cholesterol is 135 and my triglycerides are at 140.  All because my BG has stabilized.  He starts going off on how I need to lose more weight and wants to put me on a statin.  \n\nI switched doctors.

You've done your body a world of good even if you haven't lost weight. There are certainly unhealthy thin people out there who could learn from your diet and your exercise regime. But ultimately, if you are interested in losing weight, you need to contend with the fact that you can even overeat healthy food which leads to staying overweight. Trust me, I could eat 2500 calories of lean meat, nuts, veggies, and fruit everyday if I didn't track my calories to stop myself (and if fruit didn't have so many carbs 😢). \n\nBut if you aren't interested in losing weight, you could maybe try a different doctor.

Honest questions about Diabetes and insulin scripts in the USA,"Hello. Obligatory: I'm jakethesnakebakecake and I have diabeetus.

I've had Type 1 for almost half a decade now. And it was a huge adjustment. I got diagnosed in my mid-twenties and really had to relearn how to live life. After many years I can finally say I'm mostly comfortable going out and doing just about anything I used to do, as long as I plan carefully ahead of time, but it has been a long journey to return to an almost completely ""normal"" life.

My background out of the way, I have some honest questions I'd love to know the answers to. I'm not sure there are answers, exactly, but I've been curious about these things since I first became diabetic and had to start wading through the quagmire that is the USA healthcare system.

**Question 1:** Why are all modern Insulins only obtainable with a doctor's script? Other Countries (Canada and Mexico for example) allow for modern insulins to be purchased over the counter. Walmart (in the USA) already sells older versions of insulin I can use in a pinch, but they're very difficult to get right and since they take so long to do anything I try to avoid them. So, why is it only the insulins I strongly prefer as a Type 1 that I can't get over the counter? What's the deal? Will that ever change?

**Question 2:** Why can't we obtain any type of CGM without a script? I would argue these devices are essential to good health and a ""normal"" lifestyle as a Type 1. Stopping to poke holes in your finger is not conducive to a fun and spontaneous life and tracking bg is tricky with traditional glucometers. But because I only get 2 CGM that last 14 days per 31 days, and they often don't work or fall off early, I am always short. To the point that I'm often completely without a CGM, and also completely unable to buy another without a long series of phone calls to very exhausted sounding people who will begrudgingly resend a script that my insurance company, knowing full well the insurance company will argue they don't need to pay because they already covered 30% of the two I bought earlier...

Will we ever be able to buy CGM without a script? I know it might be expensive, but considering my insurance barely does jack for covering them anyways I'd love to have the option.

**Question 3:** And last but not least, has there ever been consideration to stamping out a License or something, so we can just flash the ""I am diabetic, allow me to buy insulin"" card? Is that too crazy a concept for our society? I know the cure is only 5 years away but let's be real here. Once diabetic, it's sort of permanent. We will always need insulin. We should always have the ability to go and obtain a CGM. And yet there's miles of red-tape between us and what we need to live. And I am seriously struggling to understand the logic supporting why this is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14veo3w/honest_questions_about_diabetes_and_insulin/,"['T1 30+ years and wonder these same things.

My mom is now Diabetic,"Hi guys my mom was just in the hospital yesterday for having high blood sugars. Unfortunately she had to get 2 rounds of fluids in her to get down to normal. She has been prescribed Metformin and will be seeing a primary physician coming up. But in the meantime I wanted to look for resources for her. I’ve done my own “research” and have a standard idea how dieting and balancing carbs work but I get conflicting information. Also my mom is mainly Spanish speaking and was wondering if there is someone on Facebook, Instagram, or TikTok that gives reliable information in Spanish for her. 

Thank you for reading and I appreciate that there is a community here for this. I will be reading through some post to get personal experiences from you guys.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14v23wf/my_mom_is_now_diabetic/,"['Pretty sure all of the basic information is available en español via Google or YouTube. Just avoid anything promising you a cure, or anything dumb about cinnamon and supplements. Diabetes care is a combination of: food choices, physical activity, medication and testing/analysis.\n\nWe couldn\'t give any specifics ahead of her doctor\'s appointment, but her being in hospital and needing IV fluid means she was very dehydrated. The body has a ""homeostatic"" level it wants to keep blood glucose levels at. Blood glucose is measured in a couple of different measurements, so depending on where you are at, it will be: mg/dL or mmol/L. A normal blood glucose falls within a range of values. When fasted (not eating for several hours), it is expected to be between 75 and 99 mg/dL. And 2 hours after eating, it is expected to be below 140 mg/dL. Above 160-180 mg/dL, the glucose will be spilling out of the kidneys and into the urine, and the body will be trying to urinate out the excess glucose. Which causes dehydration.\n\nThere\'s a different test that gives a 3-month average, called an A1C or HbA1C, and it often is written as a % value: And normal A1C is around 5% more or less. The staff at the hospital may have run an A1C on her, if you wanted to look it up. 6.5% is considered diabetic which is not so good, and anything over 10% is really pretty serious, and causing damage. \n\nShe can obtain a glucometer, which is a device that can test her glucose anytime she wants. In the US, you could get a prescription for a device and for refills of test strips; but you can also go to any Walmart or corner pharmacy and buy a matching kit, with a lancing device to draw a drop of blood from her fingertip. Walmart is the cheapest over-the-counter purchase. Insurers would require a prescription be written by the doctor for the insurer\'s preferred brand of testing equipment. It is an easy and quick test. And the reason people test themselves is to see where they are at, and to make decisions on how to bring it down.\n\nDiabetes is basically a ""metabolic disease"" in which food comes in to be used for energy and building blocks. The food is mostly broken down to 3 macronutrients: proteins, fats and carbohydrates. The carbs are the primary driver of high glucose levels -- coming from plant sources by way of sugars and starches (which are chains of sugars). The problem with ""junk food"" is that it is mostly made up of sugars and starches that have been heavily processed. Meaning they take the plants and remove a lot of the fiber or they grind it up into a powder like flour or cornmeal, or rice or potatoes. And as soon as you stick it in your mouth it starts turning into sugars and glucose. So, there\'s a flood of glucose coming in faster than the diabetic\'s body can handle it.\n\nSo, don\'t drink sugary beverages at all if you want good glucose control. Avoid ""fruit juices"" and dried fruit, and even tropical fruit like bananas has lots of sugars and glucose in it. Concentrate more on farm and garden food, and less on processed food, less on the high carb fillers like bread, pasta, rice, potatoes, crusts, tortillas -- the ""white foods."" Protein is necessary for all diets for building structures, and will partially convert to glucose but at a lower and slower amount. Some fat is also necessary for structures and making hormones, but lots of fats can slow down the absorption of glucose.\n\nMedication depends on the cause of the diabetes. And we cannot guess that. She would need a proper evaluation to determine that she does not have autoantibodies for Type 1; or that she is indeed ""insulin resistant"" which is the most common form of diabetes. There\'s other reasons, but the doctor is supposed to determine that. A primary/general physician may be enough for her care, but they are not always trained to know how to diagnose and distribute the proper medication. An endocrinologist is a specialist who looks at hormonal problems, which diabetes is because it mostly involves whether the person does not make enough of the hormone insulin, or if they cannot use the insulin properly.\n\nMetformin is a common, inexpensive pill taken once or twice daily. It may cause some belly upset for the first month or so. It will slow down the release of stored glucose from the liver, and will kind of sensitize cells to open up more easily to accept the circulating glucose. Other medications might suppress appetite, or urinate out glucose or force the pancreas to make more insulin. Insulin injections are usually necessary if the person cannot make insulin (ie. Type 1 diabetes, or pancreatic damage), but for Type 2 may not be preferred because Type 2 are often making too much insulin already.\n\nPhysical activity/exercise uses up some of the stored glucose and then makes muscle cells more receptive to glucose, so maintaining muscle mass is a good idea, as is to get some daily movement -- walking is fine, as long as she is in a safe environment.\n\nThe problems of diabetes are numerous -- and there are immediate effects of high glucose (low energy, feeling hot, being cranky, slow thoughts, paresthesia in the nerves, and an achy kind of pain in different places, plus blurry vision. Long-term exposure to high glucose is much worse because it damages virtually every part of the body -- vascular damage, kidneys and eyes, nerve damage, joints become stiff and painful, changes to the skin and ability to sweat properly, and problems circulating the immune system properly, and depression and ""brain fog."" This happens because there\'s too many loose glucose molecules, and they are attaching themselves to places where they don\'t belong (glycation), and also swelling, messing up the lenses of the eye, the nerves that provide sensory feedback, that control gastric emptying and other organ functions, and ruins parts of the kidneys\' ability to filter blood. \n\nDon\'t know what you are reading and seeing online -- most of the social media you listed isn\'t going to provide enough education, and there will be a lot differing opinions telling you their way is the best. The truth is that that there\'s more than one way to improve glucose -- and low-carb, or vegan, or carnivore ways of eating, intermittent fasting or the ""My Diabetes Plate"" method are all used by different people because they have individualized preferences and beliefs. You just pick from what you are seeing and reading, and give it a try if you want; and then test your glucose repeatedly over time to see if it is helpful. If not, then experiment with a different method. Absolute perfection isn\'t expected -- she has a life-long health condition, but it can be made much better with simple ideas: Don\'t eat junky food, don\'t overeat; move your muscles; drink water; work with the doctors to find appropriate amounts of appropriate medications; and test your own blood glucose and learn from the numbers.

I know it's fine if the snack is low carb but what if I wanted a small bag of chips?,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14vfssi/humalog_and_snacks/,"[""If you want to snack, you'll need to learn how to carb count and dose properly for the carbs. \n\nYou'll have to ask your doctor about that because it sounds more like your probably on sliding scale dosing."", '[https://www.joslin.org/patient-care/diabetes-education-library](https://www.joslin.org/patient-care/diabetes-education-library)  \n\n\nYour question has more depth to it than you might realize as you bring up several topics: \n\n1. timing of meals after bolus\n2. insulin on board\n3. insulin to carb ratio\n4. insulin correction factor\n5. potential for insulin stacking (refer to insulin on board)\n\nwhile not terribly complex, these are very fundamental concepts that every T1 diabetic should understand.  These topics have been covered a lot in this forum, so you might search for them. Also, these are great topics to discus withyour endocrinologist, who should explain them to you.  You can also search the internet for these topics.  \n\nMeantime, I added a link to the education library at the joslin clinic, which has a lot of information on these and other related topics.', 'The insulin only covers what you calculated it for, so if you snack after a meal, but only dosed for the meal, the snack is not covered by those 4 hours. \n\nSome people call taking additional insulin in that timeframe ""stacking insulin"" though the term is more commonly used for when you do a correction and then are impatient and correct again before the insulin is done bringing you down.\n\nAnyway. The way I do it is I add another dose for the snack. Since you already have insulin working then, though, you may not need to wait the entire regular pre-bolus window. I\'ve had varying experiences. Also depends on whether your bg is already on the way up from the meal, for example.', 'You can Google insulin Humalog action time and see how it impacts. Foods all impacts differently, so part of the challenge of this illness is learning to line up the two impacts.\n\nYour meal doses usually will be independent of snack doses. But, there may be times (like cereal!) where you might give the snack dose at the mean to help the food dose, but then have the snack later.']"

"Laid off as T1 diabetic, what are my resources for health insurance / diabetic supplies","Hey, I’m a 30 year-old type 1 diabetic that just got laid off at the end of June and lost my health insurance. :( I’m a bit worried, considering the fact that diabetes supplies and insulin costs add up very quickly with no insurance. 

I live in NJ, but worked in NY and will be getting NYS unemployment soon, I believe the max per week currently is $504. (Waiting for the claim to be processed)

I have a Dexcom G6 CGM that uses 10 day sensors and a transmitter that I replace every 90 days. I also get an like 2-3 insulin vials (Novolog) for my insulin pump about every two-three weeks. The day before I got laid off I upgraded my pump to Tandem Slim, with a box of new supplies as well, but I might hold off on transferring my pump until I use up all the supplies from the old one before jumping to the new one.

Are there any resources specifically for type 1 diabetics? I don’t know where to go or where to apply for help. Like if there are any known diabetic programs or resources helping cover for diabetic supplies, or if I can apply for Medicaid, Medicare, marketplace health insurances to cover me at least until I can find my next job?

I know I also got offered COBRA but I’ve been hearing that it’s notoriously expensive, (waiting for the info packet that’s supposed to come in the mail within 14 days). But I’m not sure if I can realistically afford rent and pay for COBRA health insurance at the same time (if it is as expensive as $900-$1,000). If anyone has any suggestions/past experiences, it would be greatly appreciated, I’ve only had T1 diabetes for the last five years and this is my first time being diabetic/ laid off so I’m not sure if there are any helpful resources that I’m missing.

Replacing it monthly is extremely wasteful and expensive. \n\nSecond; I am in Washington state and when I was on state insurance (can’t remember if it’s Medicare or medicade) I went through a company called byram healthcare and had zero copay for pump, and supplies. Maybe Google them and give them a call to see what they can do? Their after hours customer service is terrible so make sure you call during their business hours. \n\nAnother word of advice is to ask your doctor to write your prescription for more than what your tdd (total daily dose) that way you can have some insulin stock piled.

I just started a new job after six months of unemployment (laid off too). Worst case you can use a cheap glucometer and walmart insulin, but it wont come to that probably.

My mom got diagnosed and I need help,"TLDR: questions in the end of the post 

My mom (53) had a stroke. 

Something was wrong with her face. We called ambulance. They didn't want to take her to the hospital but checked sugar and it was really high. 19, as I remember. We didn't actually know it was a stroke before she got to the hospital. 

At the hospital she was told she has type 2 disbetes and apparently has it for some time already (months if not years) . 

She is home now. She takes Metformin (500 in the morning, 1000 in the evening), Jardins, Glikazid and some other meds — all prescribed at hospital. 

My mom (and tbf all my family including me) doesn't have healthy relationships with food. So our family diet was always a mess with lots of sugars and carbs, fast/processed food - you name it. After mom's diagnose we are trying to change it.



So I have few questions. And I really appreciate any help because I feel overwhelmed with all that is happening. 

1. Food /diet 
Any good resources for diabetes (T2) friendly receipts? I want to cook meals that are tasty and appropriate for her new diet so she doesn't miss 'bad' food that much and wouldn't want to cheat diet. Because of some past issues, she feels bad when has food restrictions and my goal to minimize stress 

2. Any resources for ""new"" to diabetes? 

3. Anything you wished you knew earlier? 

4. What should I (person who takes care for her, managing doctors appointments, etc) should pay attention to?

Update on new dx of pre-diabetes,"Original post linked

After adjusting diet to keep carbs complex and under 50 throughout the day, and adding testing, my waking/morning glucose remains in 120-129 range

Bedtime glucose is 130's

Mid-day, before eating, when I get ""the shakes"" glucose is 104 at lowest and 118 highest. 

A1C was 6.4 in June, having been at 6 the last 3 years (I was mistaken in my OP that it was 7)

Dr wants me to take metformin XR with retest in the fall but I haven't started it yet. I'm terrified as I already have a lot of GI issues and adding anything to make me more nauseous or poopy just isn't thinkable. I also eat my lightest meal of the day, a few hours before bedtime due to GI issues. Pharmacy recommended taking it with heavier evening meal...

I'm 5'1"" 127lb and in my 60's

I feel like if I cut out all the simple carbs and eat for prevention, I can skip the meds. I don't know if lowering A1C in that way is doable in three-four months. 

For all y'all out there fighting it for so long, you have my respect. It's a lot of work and I can't imagine managing this long term. But y'all do it and I'm humbled.

Thoughts on Heavenly Chocolate / Green Cola?,"Hi all,

Green cola, again they state no preservatives and is sweetened using the stevia plant but also has sucralose.

Accidentally took fast acting insulin for WEEKS thinking it was long acting,"Yes I am stupid but here’s what happened: so I (18F) have been a Type 1 diabetic since I was 13. Things have been a little shifty with our insurance so my types of insulin pens, both long and fast acting, would change around a lot depending on what our insurance covered. So, about a month ago I ran out of my regular long acting and looked in my fridge to get a new pen. My regular type wasn’t there, but I saw a pen that looked familiar and believed to be a type of long acting insulin I had taken in the past, assuming it might’ve just changed again. I take the long acting at 11 in the morning, and for some reason it would ALWAYS drop me low. At first I thought it was because I got into kind of a habit of not eating until later in the day, but when I would eat it still happened. By the way, I was taking about 30 units a day. I even told my new doctor (who was a misogynist but that’s another story) the types of insulin I was taking and what was going on. AND SHE DIDN’T EVEN QUESTION IT. Then yesterday I started thinking, looked it up, and found out that my stupid ass was taking fast acting thinking it was long acting. I want to punch myself thinking about how much insulin I wasted. I was shocked.

Increased anxiety from Metformin?,"Hey, y'all.   


I have seen some older threads on this subject but thought I'd start a new one to see if more folks have had similar experiences. About three to four weeks after starting Metformin (500mg daily), I began experiencing extreme anxiety and an almost complete loss of appetite. Food has become so unappealing to me that even the mere suggestion of it makes me feel nauseated. It takes me hours to finish a small meal.   


The anxiety has been the worst part, tho. I finally reached a breaking point today and took myself over to the ER. The ER doc's advice: stop taking metformin immediately. Anxiety is apparently one of the ""less common"" side effects, but the more common GI side effects are similar to the somatic symptoms of anxiety.   


I have been medicated for depression and anxiety for years but had been doing well with both until recently. While I have been experiencing increased stress over the last few weeks from work and elsewhere, my anxiety level just doesn't seem appropriate.  I can't concentrate. I wake up earlier and earlier with more and more anxiety. I feel like I'm barely hanging on.  


If you've experienced anything similar, I would love to hear from you. Today is my first day off metformin. I wish I could say I am hopeful things will improve, but the cloud I've been under is heavy and wide (like me). Any encouragement would be greatly appreciated.

Problems with my girlfriends diabetes,"Hey guys, so this might be long so I apologize in advance, i’m just looking for some advice. To put it as short as possible, my girlfriend has had diabetes since 9, and i’ve took her to the er for low numbers, DKA scares, and so much more mostly pertaining to diabetes. i’ve had to call 911 for her 3 times to get an IV with glucose because her number gets insanely low and extreme delirium. Her main problem is night time after she’s fell asleep. She recently got Dexcom and it’s been 10x better than before which i’m so thankful for and she seems to be happy with it. i’ve learned everything i know about diabetes from her and her mom, she’s the first person i’ve lived with that had diabetes. we’re both 19 if that means anything.

So down to why I made the post. More often than not her number goes either super high (300+) or super low (45-) while she’s asleep. When i’m home, I stay up usually all night due to my schedule for work being 7pm-5:30am and I watch her number on the app. When it gets low, I grab her some orange juice and a glucose tablet and try to wake her up. When I wake her up, she starts calling me names like “piece of sh*t” and “stupid bi*ch” along with moans and just overall bad attitude because I woke her up out of her sleep. She’s a super sweet girl and when her number is good she wouldn’t ever say stuff like that to me so I don’t hold it against her but it’s just so hard to deal with the way she acts sometimes. She doesn’t seem to care as much as I do about her health and values sleep over her health. I force her to drink the orange juice which is always a struggle that takes atleast 20 minutes.

It takes professional help to navigate this type of problem long term.  What I feel should be the focus is the poor healthcare your girlfriend is getting, assuming she is doing what she is told to do as far as her care regimen.  It is well documented that glucose variability causes mental deficits and personality changes.  Everyone’s focus should be on why your gf’s glucose is so out of wack, especially at night.   I once counseled a woman who was on 70 extra units of long acting insulin and who had gained 50 pounds.  Basically, her doctor was an idiot.  If your gf is on long acting insulin, she may be on the wrong kind or be taking too much.  She may be over treating her highs or under bolusing for fatty meals.  Her monthly cycle can be causing issues and even sex can make us crash an hour or so later.   There are many reasons why your gfs glucose is so variable but the point is, all of them are controllable if you find a better care team and do the work to figure out how to remedy the situation.  She may need to go on birth control, or break up her long acting dosage, or change her long acting insulin.  Of course, a pump with control IQ is ideal.  If you focus on fixing the reason she is being verbally abusive at night, then she will be in better health and it will no longer be an issue.  When we are in it, it’s almost impossible to see how to get out of it.  That I can say with certainty.  I have a written list of actions to take when my glucose seems off because troubleshooting is not very easy when your head has been in a blender for awhile.

The low crankiness is likely much less at 70 instead of 50.  If she’s still cussing you out at 70 it ain’t the diabetes.  You’re both adults.  She needs to start acting like one.  You aren’t her mom.', 'Wake her up earlier. If she gets upset, say it is because her sugars are dropping. If she values sleep, she should take care of her sugars so you don’t have to wake her up in the first place.', ""I'm sorry you have to deal with the verbal abuse. It's not your fault she is not taking care of her own health and causing relationship problems. She needs to set her Dexcoms alarms and learn to manage her own disease. \n\nI have nocturnal hypos that i have managed on my own since childhood. I wake up from it on my own half the time. Other times my CGM alerts me and I wake up before it gets too low."", 'The best way to minimize highs/lows during the day and night with a CGM and no pump is to effectively: 1) Remain active as much as possible (40-60 mins walk every day for example), 2) Eat healthily with a steady amount of daily carbs/fats as much as possible, 3) Take the right amounts of long lasting and fast acting insulin for the amounts of carbs/fats being eaten daily and the amount of activity being carried out daily. i.e. 3) is dictated by 1) and 2).', ""Agree with what others have said.  She needs a pump if possible.  If not, she needs to adjust her long acting insulin.  I would take mine in two doses, in the morning and in the evening to make sure I was covered overnight.\n\nAlso, because she doesn't seem to wake up from notifications from her phone when her Dexcom hits highs and lows, I recommend a Fitbit or Apple Watch that can connect to Dexcom.  I have a Fitbit with a clock face that feeds me my BS and if it hits the thresholds I've established, it vibrates and wakes me up.

I admit that I feel like crap and get angrier more easily when my blood sugars are off (for me it's when they're high, not when they're low) but I don't take it out on people around me. You shouldn't put up with that.\n\nAlso, managing your girlfriend's diabetes is her responsibility, not yours. She has a Dexcom? A continuous glucose monitoring system? Then you shouldn't have to also monitor her blood sugars.

When I came back to consciousness I didn’t know or remember I had said that. My mom is quite familiar with my diabetes but she was teary explaining what had just happened to me. I felt terrible and cried. She may just be experiencing a bit of a diabetes burnout. It gets to be a lot managing it on top of daily tasks. Especially when managing it becomes more challenging than not most days.  It’s a full time job on top already a full time job\\school or whatever.

It sounds like the abuse you are experiencing is all the fault of the disease. When you are low, you are not yourself. \n\nThere are other way diabetes effects our mental health as well. The tedium of having to dose for everything… the feeling of being a pin cushion. If you are already depressed, managing diabetes can make it worse. \n\nWith my kid, I have become the face of the care regimen. How much anger they have towards having to do the things is aimed at me, and that is not okay. Thing is, as a caretaker you have to determine what is okay and what isn’t. \n\nJust reading your story here, it sounds like you have experienced what it’s like dealing with a low person. Even still, if both of you have access to therapy, use that access. Sometimes we need someone to talk to, and the internet is not always the best place to do that. \n\nHowever, it’s sounds like your GF is experiencing lows frequently. This may point to an issue with your treatment regime. If you can, I would have her bring it up with her endocrinologist. Other people have mentioned using the pump, and I will agree, the pump is a medical miracle. It has worked well for us. \n\nOne thing I don’t see mention of is the pump can be prohibitively expensive depending on where you live, and your health coverage. We live in the US, and with our health coverage, the co-pay for the pump is $4k (that we pay in installments) with a $400ish re-supply every 6ish months. It sucks, but it’s worth it for us. \n\nThere’s a lot of nuance to dealing with this issue. Nobody here is going to have the absolute correct answer. I’ve seen some people in this thread lash out like my kid lashes out at me when I’ve tried to remind them to check their blood sugar. \n\nGet some therapy if you can and see if you can figure out why she is going low so regularly.', 'Lol are you me? Mine does the same thing. She’s in all reality a very sweet person, but something about being high/low at night is like feeding a mogwai after midnight. \n\nHonestly, I’ve just learned to ignore it or laugh about it. On some level she’s right that you don’t or can’t understand if you don’t have diabetes. Being woken up in the middle of the night is already unpleasant, let alone waking up into an altered mental state.\n\nIf I had to guess, she’s probably a little burned out and longing to feel ‘normal’. That can make you resent anyone that reminds you of what you’re trying to ignore, even if temporarily.', 'You are an amazing person, thanks for taking care of her!', ""  \nShe needs to do what she needs to do to better control her diabetes so that this isn't a routine experience. \n\nThe plan shouldn't be for you to try and do your best only to be treated like shit and then later be told well if you had diabetes you'd understand. She's right since this is her diabetes she should deal with getting it under better control so these incidents are rare. Beyond not having to have you deal with them, the roller coaster of highs and lows makes people feel awful & that's not fun.   \n\n\nA Dexcom and pump that are connected will help. Pump can suspect insulin or give extra to help try and stay in range. Will know to give less based on trends.  \n\n\nA snack with protein and fat with some carbs before bed can help some people stay stable throughout the night.

You learn it takes a specific personality and grit to want to do what's best for your body. Some people aren't as interested in managing their diabetes care, others find it super fascinating. Diabetes is a very difficult illness, even when I am at my best days I find it sometimes all too much to bear. It sounds like your girlfriend isn't capable of taking care of herself in the way she needs and needs time to become more mature and decide what she wants to do. Diabetes care is very expensive so I can understand her not being able to afford a pump, and having a CGM is a massive tool that can be helpful. But this story is about you too, and you deserve a partner who treats you right. Even when I am at my lowest and highest blood sugars, I have never called my significant other nasty names like that. Sure, you don't feel good because your blood sugars are off but you don't suddenly lose your ability to control your actions. It sounds like a massive red flag and I would consider going separate ways immediately. \n\nI am going to be 20 and I go to the endocrinologist every 3 months for diabetes management, tweaking my care and ensuring I can sleep through the night without spiking or dropping. It seems really unusual to me that it is a common occurrence for her sugars to be so haywire, and there's obviously an issue there that needs to be tackled. Everyone needs some good undisturbed sleep! Which includes an obviously very caring partner who seems exhausted that their efforts seem unappreciated and disrespected."", 'She may need to adjust her basal rate.', 'I admit that I’ve gotten to that point before. It’s not ever our partners fault (or in your situation, your fault) we get so overwhelmed with having it, and feeling like we got it down pat, and then it sky rockets or plummets super low and we just kinda have small moments or times where we mentally give up. It’s a pain in the ass. You’re awesome for learning about it and trying to help any way you can. The BEST advice i would recommend is this: MEAL PREP. Constantly and every chance you can. Not only will this benefit ANYONE, but it’s absolutely NEEDED for diabetics. If she doesn’t have any type of pump or modern therapy, meal prepping has to be it. Meat and veggies. You can even do those meal kits online, they tell you how many grams of carbs are in each meal, you can help her by getting those ready, Getting shots ready for her (if she uses the InPen or regular insulin pens) get a shot ready 15-30 minutes in advance. (This is only if y’all have a solid, set routine where if you wake up before she does, and you know y’all usually eat say at around 9am, and y’all wake up at 8am…at 830, give her the shot for the prepped meal, and then at 9, microwave it or cook it, depending on the prep time and what not) get on her ass about shit foods, like Starbucks and McDonald’s and things like that. Also, if she’s just “swingin’ it” as in, “oh i know what I’m doing! I’ll just take insulin later” refuse to go get food with her or take her (if her sugars are already high). A bad habit that i had (I’m sure a lot of diabetics have, too) is when we drop low, we don’t eat or drink something in regards to how many grams of carbs it has, our main thought is to get our sugar back up because it’s scary af but we also feel like shit when it drops low. So get her to experiment with it. She’ll have to fast for like a day or 2 (2 just to be on the safe side) have her numbers get in range. Take 1 unit of insulin, see how much that drops it. Do this for several factors (with sleep, without sleep, with simple carbs (junk food/cereal/white bread/pizza dough/pasta), with complex carbs (potatoes, whole wheat bread, beans, fruits, vegetables)…simple carbs will make sugars rise continuously over a certain time frame, while most complex carbs will actually go down and stay down with insulin shots/deliveries. There’s so much that goes into, you have to experiment with it (not you, but she does) that way she can know her insulin resistance factor, her regular insulin to carb ratio, all of it. There’s also an app i use, not sure if a lot of people know about it, but it’s called “Calorie King” and it tells you how many calories/carbs/fat whatever! Is in any food. It’s like nutrition label google for foods! 😂 all kinds of things will affect the insulin resistance, i stress WAY TOO MUCH, more than i should, and stress can affect my insulin resistance, normally a soda is around 44g of carbs and like 1.5 or 2 units will attack that properly, but on days when I’m extremely stressed, and i drink a soda, it’ll usually be like 5 or 6 units to “attack” the soda and drop my numbers back down in range. Not only should she be this knowledgeable about these things in general because she’ll be living with this for the rest of her life, but endocrinologists are pains in the ass when trying to get an insulin pump, they will tell her to do these same things to make sure she KNOWS how to take care of herself if the pump were to ever fail or malfunction. All in all, keep doing what you’re doing! You’re a great partner whether she sees it or not. And if its relationship problems too, the one and only thing i can chip in is COMMUNICATE, respectfully and effectively. Sit down with her and express to her all of these things, ask her if she’s down to try them, how much you care, how much she needs to care, if she retaliates by trying to make you out to be the problem or the bad guy, or starts a fight, or gives any type of toxic yelling or attitude, she needs to mature. Anyways, meal prep, experiment, calorie king, communicate, mature. 😂😂😂 hope this has helped in any way! 🙏🏻❤️', ""You are a caregiver, which is exhausting under the best circumstances.

Honest question,"Hey y’all! Not seeking medical advice just opinions, here is a typical day of my glucose control with acarbose 100 mg three times a day.

I have suffered from reactive hypoglycemia for a decade until recently type 2 diagnosis. Doctor thinks adding metformin will help keep it under better control. Im new to this so does that make sense?

(disposable glucagon injectors) for the first time. They have a decent shelf life, and they don't need to be refrigerated--you store them at room temp.

My sibling has diabetes and I’d like to know more.,"My sibling has food addiction, like me and my other sibling, but she’s the one that couldn’t control it, and after being overweight for a while, and being pre diabetic and not taking her meds (kinda angry at her for that) she finally developed diabetes. I’m not sure what type she has, but its supposed to be the least dangerous one, although I’m not sure. I know it’s either type 1 or 2. She’s 34. She doesn’t live with me but she’s supposedly taking better care of herself and is doing a diet, but I know her and I know she probably breaks the diet every now and then to eat something sweet she shouldn’t be eating. I think she’s also taking meds but im not sure about that, and if she’s not, she’s definitely working on it.

I love her with all my heart and I just want to know the good the bad and the ugly. What will her life look like in the future? Is there anything I can do to help her? I just want to be prepared mentally for what might come further down the line.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14tw0d5/my_sibling_has_diabetes_and_id_like_to_know_more/,"['Step 1: being angry at your sibling doesn’t do anyone any good. You can’t go back in time and change anything. They can’t go back in time and change anything. Reading through your post shows a lot of blame, anger and finger pointing. So at this point it’s probably best to let that go.\n\nIt’s likely type 2, based on what you’ve said. Honestly hard and fast diets with no leeway tend to be less successful, so I wouldn’t look at it as failure if she eats/drinks something she shouldn’t.\n\nStep 2: be supportive. Offer help if she asks for it, but absolutely *do not* inject yourself into her diabetes without being asked for help. This is something a lot of us deal with and it pisses us off to no end when someone tries to police us or our eating.\n\nComplications of poorly controlled diabetes can range from tingly feelings in your fingers/toes, to vision problems, to heart and kidney problems, to amputations, it’s a long list of possible issues. But the good news is that if she gets a handle on things, the probability of encountering those issues drops dramatically.', 'Don’t try to insert yourself into her care. She can manage her disease on her own and only needs help if she asks someone for it. Also stop blaming her for her diabetes. It seems like you think that her diabetes is her own fault. It isn’t. There’s a lot of shame associated with diabetes because many peoples perception of it is that it’s your own fault. She will get better and get worse but she will need to know that you don’t blame her for this disease and that you support her.', ""Not any point in being mad at someone for having a health condition. \n\nSure, there’s plenty people can do to take care of their diabetes, but nobody is perfect. If she has Type 2, that is pretty strongly associated with inherited susceptibility. \n\nFood addiction is part emotional but also part physiological. You see, with the newest class of GLP-1 and GIP receptor agonists, so many people are suddenly losing weight and having near normal glucose, in large part because the medication is mimicking hormonal signals that reduce hunger by way of slowing stomach emptying. So people lose their appetite, and hence eat less and less often. They also help with insulin production and lowering release of glycogen stores. So, see it is not 100% a “fault” of someone in a voluntary manner. \n\nI mean, even if she did something stupid and caused her diabetes directly — ie. heavy drinking and pancreatitis — what would you be mad about? You’d probably either be upset because you think you care about her more than she cares about herself. But it is her body and her journey. \n\nYes. she could use help, but you indicate she has unresolved emotional confusion about food and stress probably. Maybe she needs counseling to deal with her inner issues to address that. \n\nAs far as diabetes goes, there is an A1C of 6.5% or an A1C of 10% or more — and so, the higher the A1C above the low 5%s, the more damage will be occurring from excess glucose and glycation of her tissues. Everyone has glycation but glucose readings above 100 mg/dL for long periods of time are the cause of long term diabetes complications. The higher the numbers and the longer they sit there, the faster a person will suffer nerve damage, CVD, kidney and eye problems and mood issues.\n\nIf she finds a proper doctor to prescribe her proper medication, and she can monitor her own glucose levels and make adjustments, if she can understand how her food choices — cognitively and emotionally — then she will be better off. \n\nBut if she doesn’t have access to medication, doesn’t make enough effort to choose better foods and not over eat, doesn’t understand how to manage with exercise and testing — then she has a less rosy prognosis. \n\nBut it is a individualized and physiologically — nobody here can predict your sister’s future. All we can tell you is that the problems of high glucose are reall, are painful and devastating. achoices along the way help a lot, having healthcare and personal support is part of it. Being mad at her isn’t going to help in any way — it’s not supportive. If. you love her, then that’s so nice. If you think you are going to run her life for her, that’s probably a mistake and either “controlling” or “codependent.”’ You can belp her i lots of ways — helping her organize and to have the courage to make her appointment snd go to the doctors as needed. To prepare healthy meals for her when chance comes, and to ask her how she is doing without judgement or shame. \n\nType 2, is not a choice but choices can be made to fix her glucose immediately and long term. Type 1 is completely without explanation as to why immune system goes rogue, but again, management is possible. Errors are going to happen.  Food addiction as an attempt at emotional compensation is super common. Hopefully that is her only major vice, and she can find the support and education (Diabetes Educator, books, Youtube, podcasts, support groups) to make better decisions and medication fulfillment. \n\nWhy are you here and she isn’t? You can point her to any of the support groups here or FB or in person, but it is her decision to participate. Don’t hate on her because she is sick and imperfect. It’s understandable to feel like some people don’t take warnings seriously, or don’t make good choices: or perhaps are even doing dumb things and looking for sympathy and for someone else to fix them. At which point does her body’s needs and her health needs spillover into your emotional reaction? You need to separate your understanding of health conditions more from your emotions, just as she needs to separate her intake of food more from her emotional needs.\n\nIf you have questions about her diagnosis, what her care regimen is like, what her doctors told her -- all of that is going to come from a kind conversation between you two. There's too many possibilities involved for any of us to offer more specific advice for you or her."", 'Thank you for educating me. I haven’t ever said something about this anger I have to her, but now, with all the comments from you wonderful people, I’m realizing that I need to let go of this anger and just be there for her, and I absolutely want to do that because there is nothing more that I want than to have my sister be happy and be in my life for a long time. So thanks!', 'Thank you. I’m not super angry at my sister. I just feel like she was warned about possibly becoming diabetic and she didn’t do enough to stop it, but I am realizing through these comments that there’s no point to me being angry. What’s done is done, and I agree. I only want to be able to support her if she needs it and to help however I can, without going into controlling/codependent territory. I want my relationship with her to be a healthy one. I just… I want her to be in my life for the rest of my life. I don’t want her to go blind, or get something amputated. She’s my whole world and it would be incredibly painful to see her suffer. But I know she’s working on everything regarding her health, and I trust her to do what’s best for her. I just want to help if I can. Thank you for commenting. I appreciate it, and I for sure need to get far more educated on the subject of diabetes. Thank you!', 'There\'s more than you ever imagined to know about diabetes. And there are many different suggestions from ""experts"" and some are stupid (cinnamon and supplements) and some of them are effective, even when they seem very different. But if your sister is not into keto, or vegan, or intermittent fasting, then those aren\'t going to be what she will do. And so, what she thinks matters, what she prefers matters. Now, I\'d prefer cake, pie and ice cream every day -- but I don\'t mean an unreasonable behavioral pattern like that. Rather, of the healthier options, which is the path she\'d prefer to experiment with? Nobody is born knowing this stuff, so be open minded in your interactions with her; and expect phases and changes to happen.']"

Can you Calibrate a Libre 2?,"Hi everyone,

My Dr has asked me to monitor my sugars as he thinks I am Prediabetic. 

I posted the other day about my CGM being off, and people said that the first 24 hours is generally wonky. However we are on Day 3 now, and it is reading significantly higher than a finger prick. 

Had me worried as this was 2 hours after a meal (and I'm meant to stay under 7.4mmol to be safe)

Can you Calibrate a Libre 2, or do they just suck?",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/14szjeu,"[""You can't calibrate them, no. It's one of their biggest downsides as a CGM."", 'Every two weeks the sensor quits and must be replaced.\n\nFor the first day or two on a new sensor, each new scan displays a ""check blood"" icon. You\'re expected to test with fingerstick and enter the results as a note. \n\nAbbott want you to believe the reader app uses this info to calibrate itself. It might even do that - I certainly would if I were writing the app. But nowhere in the docs does it actually say they use my input. \n\nThe Freestyle 2 design was as current as it could be at the time. Decisions are made in the midst of heavy regulation and a cumbersome approval process. \n\nThe most evidence I\'ve seen of self calibration was one of those ""try again in 6 hours."" It happened on the first day or two of a new sensor, wacky readings before, then pretty reasonable readings for 2 more weeks.', 'Third party apps (xDrip) let you calibrate Libre sensors.\n\nThey try to estimate blood glucose from interstitial fluid. Stick to finger pricks for accuracy and the CGM for trend info. \n\nI can see it not being accurate enough to monitor early stages of diabetes. This is a fault on your healthcare team though I think. CGMs (imo) are for checking how well insulin boluses have worked, monitoring overnight, and preempting highs and lows with alarms.', 'I know ot sounds stupid but prick your finger first them scan libre 10 minutes later. You should find its almost perfectly accurate or at least mine have been. At the same time a finger prick and libre 2 will not be the same because libre 2 measures insterstitial fluid and so this lags behind blood glucose by 5-15 minutes. I always find mines roughly 10 minutes. Just try it and see though as theres no harm in trying. But remember the libre lags behind blood', ""your reader is also a blood glucose meter. you may have to buy the test strips yourself since insurance is insane about one not needing test strips along with a cgm. both readings are stored in the reader but im not clear if that's transferred to the app in any useful way or at all."", 'The very existence of that manual check prompt seems to vary a lot, depending on where you are. It sounds like this may have been some FDA approval specific thing. The app doesn\'t even have that in the EU country where I\'m living. I suspect that it\'s really not doing anything other than the seriously wonky autocalibration where Abbott does include the prompt, either. Guessing you\'re probably right on that one.\n\nBesides the official app nerfing the full continuous reading function that the sensors are totally set up for, proper calibration is another reason that I regularly use Diabox on the side. I wouldn\'t use the Abbott app at all if that weren\'t how data is shared with the endo\'s office. Running the same sensor on the two different apps, the readings can vary pretty wildly between them--and I trust the ones from Diabox to be much closer to reality, even *before* finger stick calibration. Whatever ""calibration"" algorithm LibreLink is using seems pretty messed up.', 'Yes, I agree. I also think it is a fault, as my HbA1C is perfect (not even prediabetic) so I will go back to them and ask what the go Is', 'The time delay with interstitial fluid compared to blood readings can definitely be a factor sometimes. \n\nBut, I also pretty commonly get sensors which the LibreLink autocalibration algorithm reads consistently higher or lower than reality. Even when I\'m coasting along pretty steadily, it will read fasting levels a point or two off (or say 20-40 points, in mg/dl). Some sensors go high, others go low--and it is actually pretty reliable as long as I do know what the rough offset from the real reading is this time.\n\nAs mentioned in another comment here, I don\'t think it\'s the sensors themselves acting screwy, nearly so much as Abbott\'s substandard official app. Using a third party one that will let me calibrate manually, it\'s rarely an issue outside of the occasional actually failing sensor. I get the impression that with most of the ""bad"" sensors that people keep getting, it\'s more a matter of the LibreLink app choking.\n\n(The only real problem there in this case is that the endo\'s office is getting the funky LibreLink numbers. Hopefully they can figure out what the deal is when the baseline keeps suddenly jumping around between sensors. I will enter some real confirmation readings as notes when it\'s showing loads of false hypos.)', ""Hey\n\nYeah sorry, I should have been more clear. These readings were taken at the same time. I'm just annoyed that my CGM is off by so much"", ""> I wouldn't use the Abbott app at all if that weren't how data is shared with the endo's office. \n\nI asked my internist's office.

Unfortunately, I haven't seen any good solutions for getting Diabox or xdrip data into Glooko either. It seems to be very much geared toward working more directly with specific devices, which is irritating."", 'Have you read my post? \n\nTreating Dr. Said I am pre-diabetic, and gave me one to monitor..']"
Social Anxiety and Lows 🤔,"Curious about the experiences of anyone here with both social anxiety and diabetes. Pls share your experiences!

Post-alcohol meal,"Hi all, 
I'm having a hard time finding advices on how to handle a night out drinking a few drinks and how to handle a post drink meal. 
I already know the effect of alcohol on the liver and its effect on sugar breakdown, the fact that alcohol can make you drop low or skyrocket high depending on the beverage, how to be careful not to over do it with boluses while drinking, etc.. but I'm wondering about bolusing for a meal AFTER a few drinks. 

Typical situation : afterwork, you meet some friends, your sugar level is nice and steady, but you are walking a bit under the heat of summer so you eat a snack and put your pump on ease-off. Then you have a few beers (1.5l blond beer). 
A few hours pass by, your sugar went a bit high but it's steadily coming back to normal. Victory: no highs, no lows. 
You're home, you want to eat something. You can see your pump hasn't provided insuline for almost 2 hours but sugar level is steadily dropping (0.1mmol/l each 5-10 minutes)

So... Should you bolus normally for your meal ? Do you lower the bolus amount  (Like 25% less than usual) ? Do you keep your pump on ease off for the night ? 
Has anyone been experimenting enough to find some kind of pattern that works for them ? 
I usually get trapped in a paranoid scheme where I don't bolus at all and eat less than what I want/need (15gr), or don't eat at all, which of course makes me feel bad and low on energy the day after (and does not help with the hangover, even if that time it won't be that hard because of the small amount of alcohol consumed). 

On the screenshot below, yellow is the ease off period and blue is the insulin intake. I've just eaten 10Gr at 23:00, it starts raising, so I'm telling to myself ""ok the effect of alcohol is not that bad, I should bolus the usual amount"".
What would you do ?",https://i.redd.it/4nsc4fvkweab1.jpg,"['Im on mdi. When I’ve had drinks and stopped drinking for the night, I normally don’t bolus for my food. Most of the time I don’t have to cover with basal. But tbh my bg drops kinda hard when I stop drinking']"
What to eat (medium to long term) after glucagon?,"I had glucagon for the first time a couple days ago. I'm definitely stable now, didn't end up going to the hospital because it worked fine, but I've been feeling lousy since...kind of a ""last few days of being sick"" drained feeling.

From what I understand, glucagon kind of dumps resources from my muscles and organs into my blood and rapidly converts it to boost my BG level. Does anyone have advice on what kinds of things I can eat so I can stop feeling kinda lousy? Or is this maybe psychosomatic at this point?

&#x200B;

To be clear - there is no emergency right now, it has been a couple days since I needed to use it, there aren't any indications of anything needing to be reported before my next (soon) endo appointment.

Dexcom vs Libre,"My mom is thinking of switching me from the Dexcom G6 to the Libre 3. I got diagnosed as T1 in May, and fortunately my endo prescribed me the dexcom just a few days after diagnosis. I've gotten used to this device, but I wanna know how it compares to this other one.

1) How does the insertion and warm up process compare
2) Is one more/less comfortable to wear then the other
3) Which one can hold on longer (doesn't start falling off before sensor change)
4) Is one more accurate than the other
5) How different is the removal process
6) Do you really need to tap the libre with your phone to get a reading? Do you only get to see the current bs level, or does it also track it like the dexcom?
7) Is the libre compatible with any pumps?",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14slhkb/dexcom_vs_libre/,"['1. Insertion and warmup are basically the same, just with different applicators. ~~Both 60 minute warmup~~. Libre has a 60 minute warmup, G6 is 2 hours. \n\n2.

You don’t have to tap it again after that.\n\n7. The libre 2 and 3 have been approved for use with pumps in the US and have partnerships with insulet (omnipod) and tandem. I think there are a couple abroad. There are also DIY loops supporting them.', ""I am trying out the dexcom g7 now, I used libre 3 for month 2 sensors 1 worked fine but hard to take off couldn't get sticker around sensor to peel up, second sensor fell off 3 days in.

Alternative Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) Locations?,"I’ve been using the Freestyle Libre 2 on my right arm since I was diagnosed with T2 about a year ago. Unfortunately, that means my arm has become pretty torn up. I heal VERY slowly and the adhesive bugs my skin, so my right arm is quite irritated.

I guess I’m just wondering if there are any other good locations for me to put my monitor on.

I was hoping you all could help me to compare the pros and cons of different CGM locations. The two most important questions I have regarding each alternative location would be:

Low blood sugar at the gym,"So I started getting back into the gym a couple weeks ago. Today's workout was particularly intense though. I started sweating profusely and got light headed, everything was so bright I assume I was about to pass out(?) Luckily, the trainer got me a Gatorade and I started getting back to normal.

Alternatives to the freestyle libre,"I had acidoketosis around a month ago, this haven't happened for at least ten years. So I decided to take my diabetes more seriously and started using the freestyle for monitoring. I've had issues with 5sensors in 3weeks. 
First one got detached after 4days of use while showering. 
Second expired after 8days 
Third expired after 8days 
Fourth expired after 1day 
5th was applied today but kept giving the 10minutes error, after contacting support they said that I should wait at least 2hours before scanning again, waited for two hours, and wanted to read but it expired as well.

So I wanted to know if there are any more reliable , maybe cheaper alternatives and if someone has been facing this issue too. I'm really disappointed in the freestyle especially for what it costs, I buy them at around 70usd in my country and Abbott doesn't have official sellers in here .

Getting a tattoo as a diabetic ?,"Hello.

I (20M) would like to get tattoed a full sleeve. However, as a diabetic I'm wondering if if this a good or bad idea ? 

I've got a tattoo last summer (before being diagnosed) and the healing process, while being slower than expected, went very well. However, between a tattoo the size of the palm of my hand and a full sleeve, there's a difference. 

I've contacted a few tattoo artists/tattoo salons in my areas and talked about getting tattooed, and everything always go well until I mention I'm diabetic. Every tattoo artist/tattoo salon I've contacted told me they won't tattoo me because I'm diabetic and they don't want to risk anything. So, I'm wondering : can I still get tattoed as a diabetic ? If yes, any precautions I should take before and after the tattoo to reassure the artists ?

At my last blood drawn my A1C was at 6.1. The one before was at 10.4 (I just got diagnosed) and my doctor was rather pleased with how I manage my diabetes in my daily life, so I thought getting tattoed was fine as long as I regularly check my sugar level but with the responses from the tattoos artists, I believe I'm wrong.

Thanks in advance for any response.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14shy60/getting_a_tattoo_as_a_diabetic/,"['I have 3 tattoos, including one large one and one that says ""type 1 diabetic"" so my artists had no problem with it.  \n\n\nI wouldn\'t get tattooed by someone so unsure of their work that they wouldn\'t want to tattoo someone with an a1c under 7.', 'Just got the whole inside of my forearm done at Counts Tattoo in Vegas.

Lipohypertrophy on stomach,"Hi fellow 'betes havers

I'm a type 1 of 26 years, and as a result have two giant lumps on my stomach which I always attributed to being a bit fat. I've only recently discovered this so am going to stop injecting there, but I'd like the lumps to take a hike. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Any tips for getting rid of the lumps? Online resources just say to stop injecting...",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14sf2l3/lipohypertrophy_on_stomach/,"[""With the diabetes education I was taught, you can't do anything about it cause there is no medication for it or anything at all.

So, I have been using insulin pens since I was diagnosed.  In my experience/opinion, it's best to inject around the thigh area. For me, I don't feel any pain at all. Plus, I inject a lot of units, like around 10-30 units, in just 1 injection, so I could really feel a lump. But it goes away on its own as long as you don't repeated inject in the same area or near the area. From what I know, if the case is severe, it takes months to go to normal.\n\nAlso, make sure you keep your insulin pens at the right temperature cause if you don't, it might expire if exposed to long to the wrong degree of temperature.

Honestly I’ve never heard of a cure. I went to plastic surgeons to see if liposuction might help (not that I wanted to resort to surgery but there seems to be no other option) but they said lipo would most likely not work as the fat is all scar tissue and might not bounce back. All they suggested was a mini tummy tuck and seeing as that costs 10k+ I unfortunately cannot afford it.

My diabetes may have saved my life (or almost ended it),"I have untreated T2. Thought I lost my state coverage back in COVID so have been dealing sans meds since. I found out a few months back I never really lost it, the state was just unclear what they were doing when they cancelled my EBT at the time.

Anyhow, over the past month or so my right leg started getting weird. Losing strength, losing feeling, but gradually. I finally decided id head in to Express Care to get it looked at on my next day off.

My body decided otherwise, and I almost fell at work and lost all sensation in my leg briefly. I ended up on the floor at work (of my own accord, no falling).

I get rushed to the ER, and explain my medical situation. They send me to get a CT scan to make sure I didn't have a stroke.

I didn't. Instead, parked right in the part of my brain that controls my leg is a 3cm brain tumor.

If I'd gone to my PCP or express care they'd have (probably) assumed it was the T2 like I did  and pmwould have put me back on my meds and never even considered a brain scan.

Diabetes and an ostomy,"So I seem to be having an odd pattern going, and I think it is because of how my digestion is handling life with an ostomy.

See, I think it is because I sort of have a cycle going on because of how the guts are set up. I have a cycle of 4 or so days of normal toothpaste textured poop, then 3vdays of diarrhea. It is because of the food processing time (digestion is slow and the time spent allows food to process properly then I poop, which removes the slower food allowing the chyme to flow out fast as diarrhea.) 

I think that the chyme whizzing out so fast is making my body not absorb the nutrition properly so I keep going hypo. I mean, no lantus at all today and 212 gr carb and I can't seem to get above 60 unless I am hlrking down straight sugar.

Any diabetics with tongue piercings?,"I've wanted one since I was a teenager, but am worried about it not healing well. Tongues can be pretty risky -- especially if they swell and block your airways. 

I have a pretty rough history when it comes to healing from piercings. My first set of ear piercings had to get done eight times. My second set took nine tries, and only one pulled through. 

Weirdly, with tattoos I've had no issues. Since my ear piercings were done at Claire's back in the day, I'm wondering if that was the issue? Holding on to a little bit of hope that getting the piercing done at a shop might go a little smoother. 

I'm not someone who likes to take huge risks when it comes to physical healing, and if I do end up trying I'll likely get another ""test"" piercing done on another area of the body to see if healing is any easier.

I’m considered to be the healthiest in my family in terms of diet and Active life so everyone around me is pretty much shocked by the diagnosis. I’m currently still at the hospital and will be meeting with guidance counselors and specialist to help adjust me to the new lifestyle. I’ve already sat and done the reflecting, just wanted to know everyone else’s experience with the disease and ANY advise would be greatly appreciated.

More data means more control.', 'Man, I cannot tell you how much I tried to pretend I wasn’t a T1. Then I discovered the wonders of insulin.

Great luck and visit this thread often.

And this attitude from uninformed people is something you’ll have to get used to dealing with.

I felt like an A+ Type 2 and I\'d say I\'m like a D- Type 1 at the moment. Not going to lie and say that any of this is easy. \n\n\\-If you can, get a CGM. Being on insulin now, it really really helps manage lows. \n\n\\-Consider a pump or at least talk to your doctor or a rep. Multiple Daily Injections (MDI) works better for some, I am not one of them\n\n\\-Continue being active, it will make managing your glucose better. Just always keep something sweet with you\n\n\\-If you can, see a therapist. There is an existential dread that comes with the diagnosis of a chronic disease. Talking with family and friends is great but if the angst/anxiety is higher than normal, then talk to a professional. \n\n\\-Allow diabetes to reshape/reconsider your priorities. We hear and read amazing stories about diabetics who run marathons or achieve whatever lofty goal may seem out of reach. That\'s awesome but consider if those things actually matter to you. Don\'t let the diagnosis make you feel like you have to be an outlier, let it help you decide what actually matters out of the finite life we have\n\n\\-Give yourself a lot of grace in the beginning and consider a higher ""normal"" range as you continue to find out what works for you.\n\n\\- Listen to other diabetics but always with a grain of salt.

The 2 main CGMs out there are Dexcom and the Freestyle Libre. There is also a podcast that I have found super helpful and informative called the juicebox podcast, tons of great info and tips on there. Lastly I would say if you have access, look into getting an insulin pump. There are a few different kinds and it requires a little more research and dealing with your care team than getting the CGM but can be so worth it for alot of people (not everyone). Some of the pumps can work with the CGMs to calculate and administer insulin without you having to be as involved, which can save a ton of mental load. There will also be lots to learn about different foods amd timing insulins but that will all come with a bit of time and experience.

Now, 25 years later I am still here living pretty much a normal life or as normal as life can be for a type 1.\n\nToday you have the benefits of CGMs and hyper-fast acting insulins (which 25 years ago did not exist). So you have it good now compared to 25 years ago just as I had it good back then compared to Type 1s 25 years before my diagnosis.\n\nYou also now have the availability of insulin pumps but they are not a must. A CGM together with hyper-fast insulin will give you pretty good 80%+ TIR already (specially if you are continuously active and lead a healthy lifestyle).\n\nIf your living situation (i.e. country/economies, etc.) doesn\'t offer you things like pumps, CGMs and hyper-fast insulins it is still not the end of the world as long as insulin in general is always there for you (Just like it was the only thing there for T1Ds 25 years ago).\n\nYou will have ups and downs as you settle in and will forever be asking yourelf ""why me?"" but, it is important to keep things in perspective and remember that, there will always be others out there in more unfortunate positions than you.

About the only thing you might have done to avoid it would have been to live in a hermetically sealed bubble, protected from all viruses and other sources of infection, for your entire life, since it was probably some sort of infection that triggered your immune system to destroy your pancreatic beta cells.\n\nI wrote the following on another thread from a mum of a recently diagnosed boy:\n\n*""The first thing you need to know is that managing diabetes is a lot more than just balancing food (particularly carbs) and insulin. There\'s so much more to it.

Also, the more you research, learn and understand about the disease, all of the different impacts it has on various metabolic processes, how insulins of various kinds work (and how that is different to how insulin from an unimpaired pancreas works), etc. the more manageable it becomes - and it\'s fasinating to learn.""*\n\nI\'ve had T1 for 32 years and had a very full and, fankly, great life. Don\'t let diabetes stop you from doing what you want, don\'t fear highs and lows, just learn to avoid them and deal with them, when they inevitably occur.

You’re body is now going to have way more Insulin than it did before and the insulin we inject is just as effective at bringing glucose and amino acids into the muscle cells. \n\nI was 187 when I got diagnosed and am now 204. I do Peloton weight training so it’s not focused as much on mass or density training but I’ve still gotten a lot stronger since\n\nBen Tzeel and DiabetesStrong are good resources for weight lifting and being type 1 \n\nMy biggest suggestion is to wait on fast acting insulin after a workout, I typically workout between 5 and 6pm after work, if I eat dinner at 7 and bolus my normal amount, I go low after an hour regardless of the carbs in my meal. So pushing dinner to 8 or taking a lot less fast acting insulin helps prevent that \n\nOne really nice benefit to being on multiple injections is you can workout fasted in the morning as long as you’re in range. Most basal insulins aren’t going to have you go low in the morning so I always walk fasted to help burn fat\n\nSome people go high when weight lifting, I’ve never had that problem. Squats and anything chest/back related usual bring my sugar down \n\nAnd no problem, if there’s any advantage to having diabetes, it’s being able to help others who want to get control of it themselves', 'How should I go about snacking outside of my big meals? I’m 6’3 140lb so it’s hard for me to gain without eating consistency throughout the day. Also how do I eat out from now on? Restaurants, dates, movies out with friends.', ""For snacks I like nuts, cottage cheese, plain yogurt (you can add fruits, berries are best, if you're in a good range) lower fat cheeses, turkey jerky. You're pretty young and probably don't have high cholesterol/triglycerides yet but it's something to be aware of in the future so keeping things on the lower fat side is better. Diabetes just lends itself to increased lipids. Don't get too carried away with Keto foods, I did a couple years ago and I did not realize how much saturated fat is in those prepackaged foods and my lipid panel showed a big increase. \n\nYou don't typically want to take any insulin with snacks cause that can lead to insulin stacking. Thats when you take fast acting insulin too close to your previous dose. Most fast actings peak at 2 hours, so wait until 3 hours to take any correction dose. If you stack you run a higher chance of having a low BG and can be harder to correct since you're now battling new insulin.\n\nFor going out to eat, this is where I personally feel the pump is better than being on MDI. If you have a pump, especially some of the new ones that are essentially a closed loop system (this means your pump is connected to your CGM and gives insulin based on those readings), you can just eat. Your pump will correct as your BG goes up. \n\nSince you're on MDI though, I would suggest taking your insulin in the car, if you feel uncomfortable doing it in public or a bathroom. I personally, could never do it in a bathroom, just felt gross. Most fast acting insulins take 15-30 minutes to kick in so it's typically enough time before the food reaches your table. Only caveat to that, if the restaurant is busy and food does not come in time, that insulin is still going to get to work so you may go low before or high after the meal since it was mistimed.\n\nI have never taken it but there is an inhaled fast acting insulin called Afrezza. I believe it acts incredibly fast and would certainly be more discreet than a pen. \n\nBut yeah you can still go out to eat and to movies and stuff it just takes a little more planning and trying to get that timing right. And if you mistime, you mistime. It can always be corrected and you'll have a better idea of what to do next time"", 'Thank you so much for this']"

Looking for advice on G7 insertion site/pain - T1 32 male - see post for details,"Hello all, 

Some context. I've been using the G6 in my abdomen for years without issue. I just made the switch to G7 today - imagine my excitement when my endo told me it was finally available for me! 

Cut forward to today, I've got the app set up and I'm about to apply the sensor - was pretty surprised and incredulous when it suggested using the back of my upper arm as as a site. I'm a very lean/thin guy, and have almost no body fat in my arms. I felt this was certain to be painful. I Googled though and Dexcom's website says that I should use this for optimal performance.

Well, I went ahead with the arm site, and holy shit this is painful. Feels like I hit a nerve or something - jolts of pain radiate throughout my upper arm and into my shoulder when I put the slightest pressure on the sensor. 

Two questions I have for everyone who has experience with the G7 system -

1) is it okay go use my abdomen as an adult? Can anyone tell me their experiences using their G7 with their abdomen?

2) I've got to deal with this thing for 10 more days - two hours in and it's still painful as hell. Can I expect this to abate at any point or am I fucked until this session is over?

Welcome any experiences from anyone with their G7s.

Preventing Compression Lows?,"Hi all,

What Is Considered A Month Supply Of Insulin?,"Like many Medicare people, I pay $35/month for a month's supply of Novolog. In my case I get a box of five injector pens and am being billed at a two-month supply or $70 for 1,250 units.

Has anyone else experienced dramatic early changes?,"Hello, 27F, this is my first time posting here, and I hope I don't break any rules with this post. Let me be clear, I am not looking for specific medical advice with this post. Guidance is appreciated & I am mostly wondering if others are in a similar situation as myself.

This past late February (2023) I went to see my PCP after about 2 years (didn't have any issues so I didn't feel the need to go to the doctor for a while then it was 2 years later, oops). Did a non-fasting glucose test but hadn't eaten for about 6 hours or so when I did it. From that blood test, I received the diagnosis that I am a Type 2 diabetic (Glucose: 241, A1c:11.9). Was immediately put on insulin (14 at first then went down to 10 and this hasn't changed) and 2000mg of metformin.

At first, I was very scared and felt very alone as I (thankfully) have no one in my close family or friends that have dealt with this sort of thing. I try changing my diet but end up falling back into old habits because eating healthy is very expensive, especially avoiding carbs and refined sugars. I also had issues with keeping my blood sugar up at first so I started eating a lot of cookies (fat and sugar combo to maintain). So basically with falling into bad habits again and not really changing the rest of my lifestyle (add 15 minutes of extra walking since it's been warm) the only real difference is the cutting of ice cream (I wasn't eating truckloads to begin with btw) and the metformin. If my blood sugar has been exceptionally low that day I skip my insulin shot at night.

Fast forward 4 months later and I do a fasting blood test (Glucose: 90, A1c: 5.4). Given the small amount of change in my lifestyle this seems like a very dramatic change from HbA1c 11.9 -> 5.4. Has anyone else experienced such dramatic results? Are these results actually not that dramatic and are normal starting out? Does Metformin actually have a stronger effect on some individuals?",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14qxfvb/has_anyone_else_experienced_dramatic_early_changes/,"['I too had dramatic results when I was diagnosed. I spent 2 weeks in denial and then consulted with physicians with whom I worked at a medical school. They all told me the same thing, ""Stop eating carbohydrates"". This has worked for me. I keep a close eye on my numbers each day. I eat less than 20 carbs per day, some days are zero. My BG stabilized below 100. My last A1C was 5.0. So, dramatic results are certainly possible. I was also warned not to use insulin or an insulin pusher to treat this disease. Hyperinsulemia causes its own problems and accellerates insulin resistance.']"
Undiagnosed? - Listen to your body!,"I was a prediabetic, then diabetic, etc., etc. according to my doctor visits over the past 10+ years.  I saw my doctor every 6 months, took Metformin, listened to my doctor tell me how to eat and always replied that I'd do better.  I knew how to eat right as I had lost a lot of weight using Atkins / Keto type diets (and gained it back).  But, I never got back on those diets like I said I would.  Slowly my eating habits got worse and worse.  I still ate smart by some standards, but not smart enough.

My A1C ranged between 5.5 in 2019 to 7.5 in 11/2022.

In the spring of 2023, my body started talking to me.  I had just turned 66 and started to notice my balance wasn't as good as it was, my ankles hurt, my shins above my ankles just felt a little crampy, I felt weak and a little lightheaded.  I started to crave sweets which I normally avoided entirely.  I started having extreme thirst and the associated urination.  Someone left some orange juice in our fridge, so I started diluting it and drinking that as a change from just water.  I hadn't had orange juice in 30 years.  I started to notice my vision was changing.  All of the sudden I didn't need reading glasses?  Shortly after that, my vision changed some more and everything became blurry.  On the plus side, some of my clothes fit better all of the sudden!  I had a day of housework before I flew back to our main home.  I could only get about halfway through a task before I had to sit or lay down.  I was exhausted.  My last few days before flying home were consumed by resting, drinking and peeing.  I don't think I ate anything for 2 days.  I got on the airplane and flew home without any problems.  Once in the airport, my thirst took over again and I had to stop at every drinking fountain on the way out of the airport.  I contacted my doctor and saw him two days later - early May 2023.

While showering to get ready for the doctor appointment I could barely stand in the shower.  I figured this is what a heart attack is - except I had no pain.  I had a hard time holding my arms over my head.  I knocked a bunch of stuff over in the shower and my wife, who had been hovering in the background came rushing in.  My wife wound up driving me to the doctor.  I think I could have driven myself, but it wouldn't have been a good idea I'm sure.  Walking through the parking lot into the office building was a deliberate and careful process for me.

So, in the doctor's office, I tell him I feel like total shit.  He takes blood, checks a few other things and says he'll get back to me.  That night I get a phone call at 11:30 pm.  It's a nurse with the hospital my doctor is affiliated with.  The nurse tells me my blood glucose reading is 541 and the doctor will be in touch in the morning.

My tests start to show up on MyChart and my A1C that had ranged between 5.5 in 2019 to 7.5 in 11/2022 jumped to **16.9 in May 2023!**

I got a phone call from my doctor and he gave me the Cliff Notes on testing and injecting insulin and by early that afternoon I was pricking and sticking.  I went on Tresiba and NovoLOG.  I'm now also on Ozmepic.  In the 2 months that I've been at this, I've injected myself about 250 times.  My sugars are in a great range, my use of NovoLOG is at the minimum level or I get to skip shots and I just moved to 1.0 Ozempic.

The real message I wanted to send with this diatribe is to listen to your body, especially if you're being called prediabetic or diabetic (but not yet on insulin, etc.).  If you start feeling weird or off, you probably are.  That sudden weight loss?  Yeah, that's why they ask if you've had any sudden unexpected weight loss I guess.  Get checked if you can't check your own blood sugar numbers (which is something I totally blew off as a not for me sort of thing).  I hope this helps someone who is reading this thread trying to figure out what's going on with themselves!

Fasting seems relatively okay after eating heavy carbs last evening,"Good morning everyone!
 
I'm trying to understand something. 
I had a very stressful day yesterday and i fell back into comfort food, which was I ate a bunch of carbs.

I think I can't say for sure but if I'm guessing it's 300-350 in one go in the evening around 7 pm and didn't eat much after, just some spearmint tea.

I've been on metformin 500mg once a day for a week now.

The thing is when I woke up today and tested my fasting it was 5.9 mmol/L, which isn't low for sure but it's definitely lowe because  It's usually been 6.4 the last few days when I was eating completely low carb.

The only change is this meal and I had two omega 3 capsules arpund bedtime. In the morning I just had some celery yesterday and a glass of coffee with almond milk as opposed to my usual high fat breakfast.

Before testing in the morning I had two cups of spearmint tea again but that's it.

I'm trying to figure out why my fasting isn't higher,  but glad too.

Could it be that metformin is working?

I used to have a very very shitty diet before I got diagnosed, so is it like the conditions my body is used to maybe?",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14r4ksi/fasting_seems_relatively_okay_after_eating_heavy/,"['Metformin is unfortunately not a magic pill but the body does vary from time to time.

If you go low carb (call it 100g or less) without going all the way to keto, my understanding is that your body will adjust accordingly over time. It will release enough insulin for the expected amount of carbs. Less carbs and less volatility in your glucose levels. Keto and 300g binges are the extremes, so sticking to something in the middle that is manageable might avoid the binges while still helping with the rest of your goals.\n\nI’ve read that your fasting level average is one of the last things that changes. So weeks/months/years of good control are what really indicates progress with your fasting level. I wouldn’t read too far into this isolated situation. It might be right back to normal tomorrow.']"

Type 1 and keto and intermittent fasting,"Hello.  I have posted a couple of times on this sub and am very grateful for the always patient replies...


How would a combination of keto , intermittent fasting and very very regulated intake of glucose and carbs go ? Would you be basically be in control of the situation and not experience any spikes or lows or other complications?",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14q70am/type_1_and_keto_and_intermittent_fasting/,"['Been on keto for 3.5 years. It is going well for me, last a1c 5.5 ~91% time in range 60-140 standard deviation in the low 20s. I’ve been a type 1 for 21 years this is the best control that I’ve had. It gets easier and easier to maintain as time goes on and you see the results from putting in the work. Also I find that meals are very satisfying and I’m full so I don’t crave carbs as I have in the past. There are still times where I have “unexplained highs” but they are far less outside the norm than in the past, a high now may be a weird spike to 160 rather than 200+. On the other side as I’m taking 1/2 of the insulin I used to have to take the lows are more controllable because they come on more gradually with less total insulin on board. After a while of being very strict, I started to incorporate cheat items into a couple of random meals throughout the week. With some trial and error I’ve become better at predicting the needed insulin for those items. I’d say try it and decide for yourself, it worked for me.', 'I’ve been doing IF + keto for two years. T1 for 35 years, and I have the best control and health that I’ve ever had. Cholesterol is now at optimum levels without meds just the diet.  I used to be borderline high like 214. Now my cholesterol is 169 and looking good. Now when I first started keto, cholesterol spiked higher for a couple months and then naturally went down. I lost about 40 lbs (new normal is weight 135 lbs, 43 yo female) after adapting to the keto + IF lifestyle. I did make sure to have a good handle on insulin and keto prior to starting intermittent fasting.\n\nI started with 16:8 IF. I IF about  85% of the time.

But he is not considered “keto” as he thinks people on high fat methodology don’t fare as well long term, since protein is necessary for controllable gluconeogenesis and for building blocks, especially to maintain muscle mass. Some “keto” advocates warn against too much protein, as they fear gluconeogenesis would knock them out of ketosis. \n\nGood luck finding a suitable method. a', 'Can we talk ?', 'Can we talk ?', 'Dr Bernstein', ""How to get past that carb craving?

And if so, can he reliably take the meds as needed?\n\nIs he able to get any physical activity? Moving muscles helps to soak up excess glucose, but joints and balance, mobility issues are going to be different for him than someone who is significantly younger.   \n\nWould he be willing to eat differently? For example, cutting back on simple sugars and highly processed starches will help greatly. Does he prepare his own food or does someone else do it for him? Would want to eat more like farm and garden food, rather than junky factory food like chips and cookies and bread. \n\nAlso, healthcare might be more lax with glucose range goals for someone who is 80+, compared to someone who is younger. One fear is that they could overmedicate with insulin or sulfonylurea and suffer a low glucose, and have problems associated with that kind of incident. Some meds like metformin might also cause some belly upset for a while, so bathroom proximity might be necessary till a person’s system gets used to the med.

It is usually taken once or twice per day. One explanation for the diarrhea that some experience is that metformin also reduces absorption of glucose and the glucose in the stool has an osmotic/water attracting effect. Other than needing a toilet, it is uncommon to have low blood glucose from metformin alone. Some people have difficulty absorbing B12 while on it, and a rare side effect is lactic acidosis. \n\nThere are lots of meds, but metformin is probably the least dangerous.

What's the appropriate/correct time to measure fasting glucose? Do fasting glucose and morning glucose (dawn phenomenon) are two different things?,"Hi,

I was recently diagnosed with diabetes. My A1C is 7.1, and I started walking in the morning to control my weight.
I check my blood glucose 4 times a day, and here are my usual readings.

Wake-up (fasted): 125 to 140.
1 hour after meal: 140 to 180
2 hours after meal: 130 to 158 (mostly under 140).
3 or later hours usually: 89 to 125.

Now I was wondering what's going on with me since my post meal levels are not bad or pretty much within the range.

Is this something called dawn phenomenon?

What time after dinner I should check my fasting blood glucose? Is it 8 hours after dinner or as soon as I wake up?

Note: I ate at midnight last night that's around 12 am. I ate some veggies and a guava. Wokeup in the morning and check my blood glucose around 5:20 am, and it was 140. That's quite a bit of spike for me",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14qcipi/whats_the_appropriatecorrect_time_to_measure/,"[""I test immediately upon waking while I'm still in bed"", 'my doc said to take a BG reading first thing in the morning and before and 2hrs after my big meal for the day.

Most of us sleep for 7-8 hours and didn't eat for a few hours before sleep, so the morning glucose is the fasting glucose.\n\nSo if you had waited to check after 8:00 a.m. then you would have gotten a fasting number.\n\nYour 140 may be a combination of guava at midnight, and dawn phenomenon, but you would have to have several fasting tests in the morning to see what the number typically is without the midnight guava to see if that is happening.\n\nPost-prandial (after a meal) numbers are usually checked 2 hours after the meal was completed."", ""Going to shed some light on the whole dawn phenomenon thing. Some diabetics experience it more than others. But essentially it's when your blood sugar rises on its own without any food in the morning shortly after walking up.\n\nBasically you've been sleeping through the night so your body goes on auto pilot by keeping the vital systems running like keeping you breathing while you sleep etc etc. However, when you wake up your body has to get the other systems (like the muscular system which yes we do move a bit while we sleep but not near as much when we're awake) out of sleep mode for the new day and sometimes this process of waking up can cause your sugars to go up a bit."", ""Irrespective of what time you ate at night?

Had control. Lost it. I don't get it.,"Informally diagnosed T2D in the hospital in late April with an A1C of 9.5. Was put on 1000 mg of metformin to start, they tried to push it to 2000 initially, but I had bouts of nausea and we settled on 1500.

Just takes some getting used to.\n\nSecond, and most importantly: the remedy to DKA is not more carbs and higher sugar. That makes DKA **worse.**\n\nThe correct treatment for DKA is fluids and insulin. You need fluids to flush ketones and small doses of insulin over time along with minimal calories to keep from going too low.\n\nThird: **Ketosis is NOT diabetic ketoacidosis.** \n\nThey are two different systems in the body. There’s a lot of misinformation out there and even some medical professionals get it wrong.\n\nYou absolutely should be tested to make sure your diabetes is not autoimmune. That said, if you are a T2, it is unlikely (but not impossible) that you are experiencing DKA.\n\nIf you still have pancreatic function your body will release insulin to keep you out of DKA. Ketones in your urine can be due to weight loss or a ketogenic diet. \n\nThey don’t necessarily mean that you’re in DKA. As I said, if you’re T2 it’s unlikely to occur.\n\nWarning signs: if you experience any of the following symptoms please head immediately to the ER. Sugars remaining over 300 mg/dl coupled with ketones in your urine; nausea or vomiting; brain fog/inability to think clearly; difficulty breathing or inability to take a deep breath; breath that smells fruity and/or sweat that smells of acetone.\n\nThose are all indications of DKA and you need insulin.

"High blood sugars after eating, even after taking NovoRapid and waiting for 20 mins.","Hello everyone, it’s my first time here in this subreddit. I take novorapid and wait 20-15 mins before eating food. Few minutes after, my blood sugar shoots really high, like 200+ or even 240+. I usually eat the same food most of the time, or something else. I have only started to notice this for the past few days. Otherwise, I would eat the same food and the sugar used to be perfect. I used to do exercise and go to play football, but after a leg injury which has lasted for about a week, I can’t do an forms of physical activity. I have changed more than 4 novorapid pens due to this, but still the same results. The pens were of different batches. I am not sure if am storing the pen incorrectly, since I notice a lot of fog in the glass of the insulin pen. But when I wipe the glass, it becomes clear again. I find this very odd.   But another thing I find weird is that even when I don’t do exercise, I eat the same food and the sugars are good. But today, when I ate exactly the same thing, my blood sugar shot to 291 mg/dl. I take tresiba aswell, but that works fine. It’s only the novorapid creating issues for me. The novorapid and tresiba pens are both always stored in the same fridge at the same temperature. I am hopeless right now and I don’t know what to do. My blood sugars always spike. Even when I increase my insulin dosage, the sugar still shoots to crazy numbers. I use a FreeStyle Libre 2 CGM. I know the readings are not inaccurate since I can feel the symptoms of the high blood sugar within me. Previously, like I said, when I ate food the sugars were good and sometimes it even went low. I used to wait for just 10 minutes and the sugars still went down. I don’t modify the dose or anything. I was able to eat something more too without worrying about it spiking. So now, when I take the exact same dose I usually use to take, the sugar spikes A LOT. And just like I said, even if I increase the doses, still high blood sugars. I am a type 1 diabetic, so I am wondering if I have become resistant to novorapid or I am doing something wrong. I take insulin on the stomach. I wonder if the high blood sugars are caused by lipohypertrophy, but I don’t notice any bumps or other things on my stomach. I know this isn’t the honeymoon phase for me since previously when I didn’t take insulin for a meal, the sugars rised. Can anyone give a solution on what to do? I have been really upset about this for the past few days. Sorry for my bad English.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14q7jcf/high_blood_sugars_after_eating_even_after_taking/,"['Thank you for your reply. Another thing I find weird is that when I take insulin (novorapid) it acts after 10-20 minutes and reduces blood sugars by around 20 mg/dl. After that, I eat the food. Then, the sugar suddenly spikes with my CGM telling me that the blood sugars are rising quickly. Eventually, the blood sugar crosses 180 mg/dl. I’ve tried different pens but still same problem. I really wonder if this is lipohypertrophy since I used to inject on my arms when I first had diabetes but later noticed that my blood sugar management got worse over time when I continuously took insulin on both my arms. I was still on novorapid at that time. After that, I decided to take insulin on my stomach and my blood sugars were more predictable and manageable. Now I split the stomach into 4 zones to take insulin. For breakfast, one zone. For lunch, another zone and for dinner, another zone. This whole month, I noticed my novorapid was delayed and blood sugars rised. But the blood sugars eventually came down. (i don’t know if tresiba was effected since it is long acting). For the past 3-5 days I take insulin and wait for some time before eating food. Now it shoots to a crazy amount (240 mg/dl+) and I have to take insulin again to bring it down, but one thing which makes me wonder if this is lipohypertrophy is the delayed novorapid which takes a lot of time to act. Sometimes it just stops midway, like it just brings down the sugar by 30 mg/dl and then drops a little bit again after some time. If I take insulin and then a hot bath, the sugars go down quickly and I can eat my food without the sugars usually spiking. If this is lipohypertrophy, what can I do to tackle this? All my insulin spots have slow insulin absorption now! My leg is slow to absorb insulin, my arm is slow to absorb insulin and now even my stomach too even though the insulin is usually absorbed fast there. I am getting scared, I don’t want to do a surgery to remove the bumps. Where can I inject the insulin? Sorry for the long text again', 'That was a wall of text.\n\nRemoving exercise from the daily routine can increase glucose levels.  Injuries can also increase glucose levels.  So can worrying.  If you are reducing your water intake due to the reduced activity, that can also increase glucose levels.\n\nCheck the CGM with a blood glucose meter to verify the sensor is still good.  Assuming it is, then there may need to be additional actions needed.\n\nIt is unlikely the pens are at fault, unless they all got hot for a long time, recently.  \n\nYour delay between the shot and food is good.  \n\nIt is possible that you are at the end of the honeymoon phase, and your pancreas is producing less insulin now than a month ago.  You may need more basal (Tresiba) if you are seeing rises between meals (maybe not as you say pre-meal numbers are good or low) or you may need more Novorapid to cover the carbohydrates in your food as the carb to insulin ratio may have changed.  \n\nAnother thing to consider is changes in the food.  If you were eating brand X of food and now you have to eat brand Y, the carbohydrates may be different between the foods.   If brand X was 40 carbohydrates and brand Y is 60 carbohydrates, then the insulin is not enough to cover brand Y.\n\nUsing the same amount of insulin and eating the same food is a way to control diabetes, but bodies and food changes, so there may be a need to change the amount of insulin needed.\n\nMost of us learn how many carbs 1 unit of insulin covers (keeps us near the starting value 2 hours after consuming those carbs) and use that ratio to eat a more varied diet and take the insulin needed for that diet.']"

Update: Husband did glucose test by chance yesterday and was diagnosed with T1D today.,"I believe the original post was removed yesterday for violating the community guidelines. In short, I am pregnant and have mild GD and husband had been complaining about leg cramps for past few weeks. Yesterday morning we decided to check his BG by chance with my glucometer. The readings were twice the higher cut off for fasting and 4 times high after meals. I posted about it here and thanks to all the comments we did go and see an emergency doctor yesterday. Though the process was tedious with NHS due to weekend,we managed to get an early diagnose of husband’s Type 1 diabetes. 
As per the consultant this is late onset (he is 36) and his only symptoms were regular leg cramps and 7 kg weight-loss over past two months. He had no classic symptoms like thirstiness, tiredness, abdominal pain etc. 
No one in his family had diabetes so he never got tested either. He developed it in past few weeks and this was an early detection. He is been given insulin and will stay at hospital for observation for next few days. He will be on insulin doses and has a class tomorrow on T1D education. 
It was by sheer luck that we decided to check his glucose and captured early diagnoses. I am so thankful to this community to take time to write comments and push us to take faster actions. If it wasn’t for the comments we might have not taken it very seriously and it could have been too late.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14ot0k0/update_husband_did_glucose_test_by_chance/,"['It’s a crappy diagnosis but so wonderful that the two of you were able to catch it so early, and before a potentially devastating DKA!', 'Many T1s are the only ones in their families who have it and many folks get it as adults.

Most of my life I did not go to the doctors so I had no family doctor since I was 16.

I went into the doctors office and described my symptoms and my doctor immediately asked if she could prick my finger and i said yes. I did not register so she asked if I could urinate to r which I replied yes please. The came back and spoke with the doctor. The doctor relayed to me you did not register on the finger stick and you did not register on the urinalysis. To that I replied I do not know what that means. She then stated this the finger stick stops at 600 in blood and the urinalysis stops at 2000. My reply is ok what does that mean. Her reply blood 120 / urine less then 400. She then told me you are going to the hospital call your girlfriend to come get you. Go home get a bag packed and do not waste time and I’m calling ahead for you.
