GLP1-ATANGONIST'S and Bacterial Overgrowth?,"Okay so I'm very confused. I've been having all the symptoms of Cholecystitis. It was bad today so I went to the ER. They did blood work, urine test, ultrasound and a CT scan. Everything came back normal except that my stomach and bowels were inflamed. So the doctor said I probably have a virus. Which is possible but the most concerning symptom I've been having is pain when I move on my right side under my rib and extreme tenderness when touched for seven days. I've never heard of that with a stomach bug. The other scenario the doctor suggested was a build up of bacteria from the slowed digestion and taking Immodium(to combat the diarrhea from the Trulicity). 


So my question is has anyone actually had a build up of bacteria on Trulicity(or other GLP1-ATANGONIST's)that's caused sickness? Or pain when touching parts of your abdomen and/or moving? My primary doctor won't be in till Tuesday and I'm not finding much from looking it up. I just want to know if I'm battling a virus or another Trulicity side effect because I've had every side effect under the sun with this med. And as much as I want this to work because my sugars are great and I'm losing weight there has to be a line I have to draw. And if I'm going to constantly be having inflammation and sickness from it then I think that's my line.",https://www.reddit.com/r/type2diabetes/comments/14vkxzr/glp1atangonists_and_bacterial_overgrowth/,"['I was on Trulicity for several months and have been on Ozempic now for two months.

Prediabetes to Type 2?,Hi everyone! I am 29M. I was diagnosed with prediabetes back in January with an A1C of 5.9%. My fasting sugar used to be in the low to mid 100s. Usually between 100-120ish. But lately I‚Äôve been falling off the wagon and haven‚Äôt been eating the way I should and have noticed my fasting sugar over the last two mornings has been 176 & 155. My question is how fast can prediabetes progress to full blown type 2 diabetes? I know I‚Äôd need to get an A1C test at the doctor to know for sure but have any of you heard of prediabetes progressing this fast?,https://www.reddit.com/r/type2diabetes/comments/14u4gf1/prediabetes_to_type_2/,"[""You don't actually need an A1c to diagnose diabetes, although you should have one to monitor how well you are controlling glucose. A fasting glucose over 125 is part of the diagnostic criteria for diabetes. Have it rechecked with a medical analyzer to confirm. The A1c can tell you if this has been ongoing, or if it's just been a short term response, but if your fasting glucose is that high, they will diagnose you as diabetic regardless of A1c. \n\nYou don't actually know how fast your prediabetes progressed. You got diagnosed in January, but that doesn't mean you became prediabetic in January. It could have been going on for a while prior to that. Some people progress within a year. Others take longer. Some never do.\n\nThe treatment is really the same. You need to control your glucose. It's harder to do that once your glucose has been out of control longer, or as it gets higher. You are more likely to need medication to control it, but otherwise prediabetes is just the beginning of diabetes. They are part of the same spectrum. Prediabetes is already late in the game as far as insulin resistance goes, and you don't always have a huge window to work with. Some people progress from prediabetes to diabetes no matter what they do. Besides diet, there is a large genetic component involved. No matter what, the goal now is going to be to get it controlled better."", 'Document your diet and sleep everyday. \nYou‚Äôll see a pattern and know what to change. \n\nStress and processed carbs are the usual suspects that once tamed help bring the numbers down if you‚Äôre t2.', 'I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a full gamut of answers.

Can Diabetes type 2 be controlled by meds alone,"My dad (65) has diabetes. He's on Ozempic 1mg, and Jardiance. His A1C remains 8.4 despite the medication additions. 

He struggles to change his diet because of ADHD, which he will likely never address. I was wondering what the chances of him actually managing his A1C is without significant diet change? 

I am concerned the start of meds has decreased his sense of urgency, and this is going to end badly.

New Type 2 diabetic here,"Hello all,

I was recently diagnosed 2 weeks ago with this. So I am still learning. You would think having a father in law with it, I would already know so much, but I really don't. They just basically give you the don't eat sweets and cut back on how much you eat speech. So not helpful at all.

I already am not a very big sweet eater, and even before I found out I had it, I had already made a diet change. Stopped drinking everything but water.  Unless I am out to eat somewhere, then I might have one glass of sweet tea, which I stopped having after finding out, now I drink a zero sugar drink of some kind or water.

I will probably be on here a lot asking questions as I learn more about this, but I wanted to start this off by asking if anyone has any good recipes to share.

I really need to just change up everything completely , and I am a southern woman so my style of cooking is the southern way, full of grease, and lard lol. Fried foods etc. I honestly should say my old way of cooking is like that, I have been making big changes since last December. 

So if anyone would like to share recipes I would be grateful. Thank you all for helping me on my journey to discovering life with type 2 diabetes.

My wearable glucose monitor after diagnosis was absolutely crucial for getting a handle on Type 2,"I'm sharing this because I know it's so overwhelming to navigate everything after you are diagnosed, and I found that having a wearable glucose monitor (I was using the Freestyle Libre 2) was so crucial for learning how my body responds to food.

Some of the best advice I received after I was diagnosed was that this is ""YOUR diabetes, not just diabetes."" We're all different. Our bodies are different. There are almost no firm rules, but the rules you have to learn can only come by observing and learning how your body works. 

You could get this information with a finger-prick test, but while I was wearing it I would test myself 20 times a day. That amount of data was so helpful to seeing what was okay and what wasn't okay for my blood sugar. Some things I learned about myself include that white bread and white rice were the worst offenders for me. By contrast a small amount of something sugary or even a pastry had much less impact, or if there was a spike it was much briefer. Also, corn in tortillas and chips were pretty safe as long as I didn't go overboard. Beans were bad for me. But farro (which is basically a wheatberry, but I could use it like rice in a lot of instances) had basically no effect. Lo-carb flour tortillas were pretty solid too. White potatoes have very little effect. And across the board, including lots of dietary fiber in whatever I was eating muted spikes in a big way. 

With that information, I was able to start making informed changes that were manageable. I made wraps at home with lo-carb tortillas, and had smoked salmon elements in it like I used to have on a bagel. I made stir fries and fried rice, but used farro. If I was ordering Door Dash on a night, I stayed away from pizza and ordered mexican instead with no rice or beans (quesadillas and chimichangas end up being the best for that). If I want something junk-food like, I opt for french fries. 

That is how it worked FOR ME. For someone else it would be different. But to me the information that came from checking my blood sugar as often as possible was so crucial. Its a process of learning yourself. And for me, it's had a big effect with an initial A1C at almost 11, 4 months after that I was at 6.0 and most recently down to 5.6. I just started Ozempic and that has made me start testing carefully again to keep an eye on how my body is reacting to this new medication. 

I know it can be discouraging and there are times when it feels overwhelming. So, if you are wondering what you can do, this kind of attention might be a way to feel like you have some control over how you navigate the changes you are trying to make. At the very least, it gives you something to actually do when it feels like you don't know what to do.

It fits into the world we\'ve made the way that it does. If meds can help it make sense of this world, then that\'s fine. I don\'t aspire to be a monk anymore.

Defeated- too much medication,"My A1C went up to 8.3 from 7.2 3 months ago. I am battling kidney stones the last couple of weeks. My endocrinologist increased my medication again. I feel like I take soon much medication for being 42. I have been type 2 diabetic since I was 30.

I take 
Metiformin 2,000 MG a day
Trulicity 3mg per week
Glipizide 17.5 MG per day
And now Jardiance 10mg a day

This isn't including my mess for high blood pressure, high cholesterol and gout.

Super Easy and Yummy Lower Carb Chicken Soup,"I eyeball everything, so add to your liking.

* Big pot filled about 2/3 with chicken or veggie stock
* Bunch of fresh cilantro finely diced
* 3 to 4 cloves garlic diced or a really healthy dash of garlic powder (don't use garlic salt or it will end up wayyy to salty)
* 1/4 to 1/2 can of tomato sauce ( you can use diced tomatoes too)
* Bunch of carrots diced
* Bunch Celery diced
* 1 white or yellow onion peeled and diced
* 1/4 head or so diced fresh cabbage
* salt and pepper to taste
* 1/4 to 1/2 cup white or brown rice (optional). The rice gives it a little extra body.

Boil chicken first, I use boneless chicken thighs but any chicken you have around is fine.

Remove cooked chicken and dice it up and add back to pot

Add all the veggies, rice, and seasoning EXCEPT the cilantro. 

Bring back to a boil then simmer for about 30 to 45 min.  Once done cooking you can add all the cilantro to the pot or keep some pinches and add to each bowl ( the fresh cilantro makes a big difference).

I make it about twice a month and I'll eat it for a few days till it's gone.

Newly Diagnosed T2 with AC1 of 10.4,"On June 11, I went to the ER for a painful infected abscess, which gave me a fever. I was diagnosed with T2 diabetes after the surgery. 265 lbs when I went in.

I changed my diet since I was discharged to low carb, but I mostly eat meat. However, I'm constantly hungry despite going over 2,000 calories. I'm 245 lbs now.

My question is why does my glucose still spike up so high even if my meal has almost no carbs in it? Even a couple of handfuls of peanuts spike it up about 20 points.

For instance, yesterday, I had a bulgogi meal. I understand it is sweet, and I had a couple of spoons of rice, but my glucose went from 160ish to 280. However, the day before, I went to a Korean BBQ where I mainly ate meat and a lot of side dishes of veggies, and my glucose only went up 10 points.

My physician did his best to explain T2 Diabetes to me, but I couldn't think of good questions to ask until now. I was a terrible student growing up. My dad has T2 Diabetes as well, so I've been asking him questions, but he seems different from me. His glucose is always low, and he eats rice and carbs. It spikes to the high 200s but goes down almost immediately.

I have to keep my glucose low so my wound can heal properly.

Edit: Thank you very much, everyone! Ever since posting, I've been more mindful of what I consume. My family and friends have been accommodating as well. My blood glucose has been at the 97% target range almost daily, with a daily average of 132. If I keep this up, my physician said I might be able to stop taking insulin glargine, but I would still have to take Metformin (which I don't have issues with).",https://www.reddit.com/r/type2diabetes/comments/14pwiuj/newly_diagnosed_t2_with_ac1_of_104/,"['To see significant results, you have to take significant measures.

If you are someone like me who spends hours on YouTube or reddit all day, use some of that time researching how to get better with your type 2. It can just be reading threads and comments in here or different videos on ways to ""beat"" diabetes. There is lots of good and bad info out there, but the more you look into it, the better you are at filtering out the crap.\n\n4. Let your friends and family know. Those are the people who want you around the most. They will think about offering you seconds or desserts. When you eat out, they will think about the choices the restaurants have.

It can be a bit puzzling when you're making efforts to follow a low-carb diet, yet you're experiencing unexpected spikes. Rest assured, there are several factors that could be influencing these fluctuations, and we can explore them together to find a solution.\r  \n\r  \nWhile carbohydrates have the most significant impact on blood glucose levels, it's important to remember that protein and fat can also play a role, although to a lesser extent. Protein-rich foods can cause a moderate rise in blood glucose levels for some individuals. Additionally, the presence of fat in your meals can slow down digestion and absorption, potentially leading to a delayed increase in blood glucose levels.\r  \n\r  \nMeal timing and portion sizes are also worth considering. The timing of your blood glucose tests might affect the readings you observe. Furthermore, each person's metabolism and insulin response are unique, meaning that even with similar meals, individuals can experience different blood glucose responses.\r  \n\r  \nIt's important to take into account other factors that can impact blood glucose levels, such as stress, illness, lack of sleep, medications, and even your recent infection. These variables can influence your body's blood glucose control. Stress hormones and the body's response to inflammation, for example, can cause increased blood glucose levels.\r  \n\r  \nThe glycemic response to food can vary among individuals, regardless of the carbohydrate content. Certain foods, even low in carbs, can still cause a rise in blood glucose levels for some people due to factors like the presence of other nutrients, cooking methods, and individual metabolic responses.\r  \n\r  \nGiven your unique situation, it would be beneficial to discuss your concerns with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian who specializes in diabetes care. They can provide personalized guidance and create a meal plan tailored to your needs. Additionally, they can address your specific concerns regarding wound healing and blood glucose management, taking into account your recent surgery.\r  \n\r  \nManaging diabetes is a journey that involves various aspects, including dietary adjustments, medication, physical activity, and lifestyle modifications.

It usually happens between 3 a.m. and 8 a.m., but sometimes our bodies can be a bit unpredictable.\r  \n\r  \nAnother factor to consider is the Somogyi effect. This happens when your blood sugar drops too low during the night, causing your body to release hormones that raise it back up. As a result, you might wake up with higher readings in the morning.\r  \n\r  \nStress and illness can also play a role in elevated blood sugar levels. If you were feeling stressed or under the weather during that time, it could have affected your body's response.\r  \n\r  \nLack of sleep can mess with your blood sugar control too. If the cat's antics or other factors interrupted your sleep, it might have contributed to the spike.\r  \n\r  \nAdditionally, if you take medications or insulin to manage your blood sugar, the timing or dosage could be a factor. It might be worth discussing with your healthcare provider if you think that could be the case.\r  \n\r  \nRemember that blood sugar levels can be influenced by various factors, and it's important to look for patterns over time to better understand what's happening.

Lack of sleep could certainly be a significant factor in the spike you experienced in your blood glucose levels.

Those disturbances can really impact the quality of your sleep, and it's well-known that sleep deprivation can affect blood sugar control.\r  \n\r  \nEven though you've been accustomed to getting by with less sleep since your late teens, it's important to recognize that adequate sleep is crucial for overall health, including proper blood sugar regulation. Our bodies need sufficient rest to function optimally, and consistently not getting enough sleep can have various negative effects.\r  \n\r  \nWhen we don't get adequate sleep, our hormone levels can become imbalanced, and this can lead to higher blood sugar levels.

Sleep apnea is a sleep disorder where you experience pauses in breathing or shallow breathing while you're asleep, often accompanied by snoring. It can really mess with your sleep quality and overall health.  \nIn the case of sleep apnea, those pauses in breathing can lead to drops in oxygen levels and fragmented sleep. These factors can have an impact on your body's ability to regulate blood sugar levels properly. It's been found that sleep apnea is associated with insulin resistance and a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes.  \nIf you suspect that sleep apnea might be behind your situation, it's a good idea to reach out to a healthcare professional. They can take a closer look at your symptoms, maybe recommend a sleep study to diagnose sleep apnea, and discuss suitable treatment options. One common treatment is using a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine, which helps keep your airways open during sleep and improves your breathing and sleep quality.  \nAddressing sleep apnea can not only have a positive impact on your blood sugar control but also contribute to your overall well-being and better sleep. It's definitely worth exploring this possibility with a healthcare professional to see if it might be a factor in your case.""]"
My Ozempic / Mounjaro Journey,"TL;DR: doctor's office fumbled prior approvals and new prescriptions, leading to serious nausea/digestion issues.

I was diagnosed T2D back in April 2022: 267lbs; 290+ blood sugar; 12+ A1c. Was put on .5 mg Ozempic and diet change. In September, doc moved me to 5 mg Mounjaro. Never had an issue with nausea on either med. 

In January, got laid off my job and lost insurance coverage at the end of February. Made sure I had refills through the beginning of May. Went on the exchange for coverage (better known as Obamacare) but the exchange plan did not cover any of the new class of  incretin mimetics. So had my fingers crossed that I would find a new job.

I did! Started in March, but insurance would not kick in until May 1st. This is where the comedy of errors began. On May 1st, called my doc and let them know I needed a refill (and only had one pen left - and woukd be using it the next day) but had a new insurance and it would need to go through prior approval and it would need to be expedited. They said ""cool"". But it appears that someone at the office didn't think it was necessary, so never submitted the prior approval. On May 4th, called the pharmacy benefit management company (PBM) to check status. Said they never received a request for prior approval. 

Back to doc - this is when I find out they didn't think it was necessary. But we will do it now. They did, but didn't expedite it. On the 8th I call the PBM and was told it was being reviewed but no request for expediting was submitted. Missed my shot on the 9th. On the 11th, the prior approval was denied. The PBM did suggest I trying using a Good Rx card for a discount on the Mounjaro. That was good for a laugh.

The PBM stated I would have to go with Ozempic or Rybelsus. For whatever reason, the doctor office delayed the prescription. Finally on 5/15, they prescribed 2mg Ozempic.

First shot - no issues.
Second shot - mild nausea.
Third shot - all hell broke loose.

Back when I was pre-diabetic, I was put on Metformin. For two months I was eating crackers and water because it was all I could eat and drink. Was never able to tolerate it because of the constant nausea. This was so much worse. The highest dose of Ozempic I had been prescribed up to this point, was .5mg. I had the full experience: nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, feeling extremely shitty. A couple of times I wound up with low blood sugar because I was having trouble keeping food down - testing at 73/75. Called my doc about 4 days into week three and was like ""what is happening?""

This is when the doc goes ""oops!"" I was told that because of the two weeks being off of incretin mimetics, they should have started me at the begining again. I was shown how to do a half dose for the remaining pen and then  a new 1mg pen was ordered. Heading into the end of June, the nausea and diarrhea is still around, but manageable. And then got the news that Mounjaro was added to the formulary as of July 1st. Was on the phone with my pharmacy first thing Saturday to get my Mounjaro prescription submitted and without the Eli Lilly discount card - $25/month! Hoping I can leave this nausea behind.

Just wanted to add:

Movement while injured?,"Walking after lunch and dinner have had such a positive impact on managing my blood sugar (and mental health) this last year.

These bands are versatile and can help you target different upper body muscles.\r  \n\r  \n**Core exercises:** Although they don't exclusively focus on the upper body, core exercises like planks or seated Russian twists can engage your abdominal and back muscles without putting excessive strain on your lower body.\r  \n\r  \nRemember to start with lighter weights or resistance and gradually increase as you feel comfortable. However, it's important not to overexert yourself and prioritize your recovery. You wouldn't want to aggravate your injury by pushing too hard.\r  \n\r  \nIn the meantime, consider exploring alternative ways to manage your blood sugar levels, such as making adjustments to your diet or finding other low-impact activities that you can comfortably engage in.

These include non-starchy vegetables (e.g., leafy greens, broccoli), lean proteins (e.g., chicken, fish), and healthy fats (e.g., avocado, nuts).\r  \n\r  \n**Prioritize fiber-rich foods:** Foods high in fiber can help slow down the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream. Include sources such as whole grains, legumes, and vegetables like Brussels sprouts or broccoli.\r  \n\r  \n**Be mindful of carbohydrates:** If you're going to consume carbohydrates, focus on complex carbs with a lower glycemic index, like whole grains, sweet potatoes, or quinoa. It's generally best to avoid simple carbohydrates and sugary foods.\r  \n\r  \n**Include protein and healthy fats:** Combining protein and healthy fats with your meals can help slow down digestion and minimize blood sugar spikes. Consider adding sources like lean meats, fish, eggs, tofu, nuts, or seeds.\r  \n\r  \n**Stay hydrated:** Drink plenty of water to help flush out excess sugar and support overall hydration.\r  \n\r  \n**Portion control:** Be mindful of portion sizes to avoid consuming excessive carbohydrates or calories.\r  \n\r  \nNow, in your specific situation, since you mentioned you're about to go to work and you're feeling hungry, it's important to have something to eat.

Instead of the smoothie, opt for a lower-carbohydrate and protein-rich meal. For example, a salad with grilled chicken or salmon, mixed greens, and non-starchy vegetables.\r  \n\r  \n2. If you need a quick snack, try having a handful of nuts (like almonds or walnuts) or a small serving of plain Greek yogurt (unsweetened) with some berries.\r  \n\r  \n3.

5.7. She was shocked, I was shocked, my mother was shocked. I got diagnosed like a week or so ago. My other ‚Äòstats‚Äô as I like to call them are still perfect.

I haven‚Äôt been amazing making changes. Sure I don‚Äôt eat takeaway on weekends now, I drink strictly water now (kicked my 3 carton a day orange juice habit) and I‚Äôm easing back into exercise after knackering my ankles (working out, funnily enough, it had been a while and I pushed myself.) I ate wholegrain carbs mostly anyway and wasn‚Äôt eating big meals (good) / anything at all (bad) beforehand unless it was a social thing / weekend so that hasn‚Äôt changed.

However I‚Äôve caved and ate some chocolate and potato here and there. I like chips, sue me (fries for the Americans here.) Small bag of crisps now and then (chips, for the Americans here.) Not massive servings, like small portions, handfuls or pickings. Just to satisfy cravings before I simply binged it. I‚Äôm still not sleeping well and I‚Äôm always stressed‚Ä¶so with all this in mind‚Ä¶what gives? Idk, but I‚Äôm overwhelmed.

Anxious, upset, happy, confused, it‚Äôs a lot. Not as angry as I was when I first posted though. My friends and family have definitely been more supportive too which has helped.

I‚Äôm due to see a dietician and because of my age and lack of any other health issues have been referred to the endo up the hospital to check if it‚Äôs any rarer form of diabetes, just to rule it out.

I‚Äôm quite happy with this result. I‚Äôm not the healthiest still and I still need to learn better habits but the fact my body is responding well to little changes and meds is relieving and makes me feel more confident I can do this.

Newbie here. üëã,"Just got my first medical diagnosis after requesting an A1C blood test. 

My fasting A1C was 143 (6.5), and my Dr has prescribed me to 500mG Metformin Extended Release. I‚Äôve read, and witnessed first-hand the horror stories. I do not want to be on this, if I can help it. 

Some context: I‚Äôm 40, I‚Äôve been eating like total garbage (pizza, fast food 5x per week, Taco Bell, ice cream, cookies, etc) for the past 6-12 months.

My Mother and her mother (my Gma) both had Type 2, as do many/most of my aunts and uncles. Unfortunately many of them didn‚Äôt take care of themselves before it was too late. Hence, why at 40, I decided to proactively find out where I stand. 

Me now: I‚Äôm a little bit scared, disappointed, worried, also determined. I already began shopping and putting together better meals. I‚Äôve been in fantastic shape most of my life, only over the last year or two I‚Äôve fallen into depression and poor habits. 

I plan to begin testing my blood 3x per day and report back to my Dr. with hopes that healthy eating show some type of benefit, and lower my glucose number down, below the 6.5 I recorded last week. 

I‚Äôd love to NOT have to take Metformin, if I‚Äôm able to prove I can diet/health my way back to below-T2D levels.

Anyway, that‚Äôs my story. And I‚Äôm glad I found this subreddit. Hope everyone is managing today the best they can. Cheers!

If there are very few carbs, I only check at 2 hours post meal. If there are more, I‚Äôll check at 1,2, and 3 hours post. Anything more than about 15 carbs per serving I avoid.

Diagnosed with type 2,"2wks ago I was in the hospital for a week due to a really bad asthma attack. Had my A1C checked since I informed them that I was pre-diabetic.

Frustrating Situation...any suggestions? - this is long,"Hey, I'm dealing with a really frustrating situation, and I'm stuck as to where to go from here. I'm not looking for medical or legal advice, obviously, but just wondering if anyone has experienced anything similar and might have a suggestion as to what I might try next.

It's a long, obnoxious story, so I'll put it in a timeline, so y'all can see how long I've been dealing with this.

Sidenote, I recently changed my insurance (because of work) and pharmacy (because it was significantly cheaper for some of my other meds than the one I was previously using).

5/3/23 - I requested a refill of my Humalog through my Endocrinologist's online portal.

5/5 - Got a message saying the refill was approved.

5/31 - script has not been sent to the pharmacy. Submitted another request. Did not receive a response, but can see that it was viewed by staff on 6/6

6/1 - left a voicemail on the ""refill"" line explaining that I was leaving for a trip on 6/5 and did not have enough Humalog to last until I got back

6/2 - left a voicemail on the nurse line with the same message. There is a note stating that a nurse got my message and sent the Rx to the pharmacy

6/4 - got an email from the pharmacy saying that they got the Rx, and it will be available 6/6.

6/5 - Leave for a week. I had to ration the insulin and be super conscious of what I ate. I ran out completely on 6/8, and returned on 6/9 in the evening

6/10 - went to the pharmacy to pick it up. Was told it required a PA, which the pharmacy notified my doctor about

6/12 - left a voicemail on the nurse line asking on status of PA. Received a call back saying that it was just submitted and approved

6/16 - called pharmacy was was told there is an ""insurance issue"" and they will contact me when it is resolved.

6/22 - Many phone calls on this day....  
\-My insurance says that they received the PA on 6/13 and it was approved for the medication but not for the dose. When asked why I, the doctor, or the pharmacy was not notified, they said that it's my responsibility to make sure these things are done correctly. They told me to have my doctor submit a new PA for a quantity exception. The max daily allowance is ""1.13"".  
\-Left a message on the nurse line, and got a call back. Explained what insurance said. The nurse said she has no idea what they're talking about. They submit all PAs with medication and dose. She also doesn't know what ""1.13"" means. My max daily amount is 80 units. She asked me to call the pharmacy and ask them to ""adjust down for priming"" and let them know if they need a new Rx.  
\-Called the pharmacy and explained the situation. The pharmacist tried running the Rx at ""95"" and it was denied. The pharmacist said I need to call the doctor and tell them to write a new script with a lower dose because my insurance won't allow me to take that much.  
\-Called and left a message on the nurse line.

And that's where I am. I'm seriously ready to give up. I have never had to do all of this to get any medication filled, let alone something as important as insulin. I feel like I somehow got the ""holy trifecta"" of bad doctor, pharmacy, and insurance, all rolled into one. There's not much I can do about the insurance, and I'm looking into a new provider and pharmacy, but I still need to get this filled.

Coping with anger‚Ä¶,"I was diagnosed a few days ago and can‚Äôt stop feeling angry.

I‚Äôm not obese or particularly overweight (could lose a pound or two, nothing mad,) I‚Äôm only 25 and whilst my diet has never been perfect in what I‚Äôm eating‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt really eat much of it at all and don‚Äôt eat half as bad as some people I know.

Yet somehow I got saddled with this. I have friends, family and a partner who eat their weight in crap and drink their calories like it‚Äôs nothing and they‚Äôre fine, yet I, who can‚Äôt even finish full meals (eating disorder damage, depression, blah blah,) who is thinner than some of them‚Ä¶am here. 

I see people bigger than me on the street eating doughnuts, takeaways, etc and get mad that they‚Äôre probably fine too if they‚Äôre doing that, or that they‚Äôre doing that when I‚Äôm actively trying to better myself and suffering for it.

It‚Äôs stupid and immature but I can‚Äôt help but feel this rage. I haven‚Äôt been perfect with my diet or exercise regime but I‚Äôve tried where I‚Äôve been able to and yet it feels all for nothing. I resent everyone who isn‚Äôt dealing with this and resent myself for getting here. All I feel is shame and rage.

I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll cope with this for life. Food seems joyless now. I never enjoyed eating anyway and now it‚Äôs worse. Old eating disorder habits are coming back while restricting myself. My medication is making me feel sick so I‚Äôll have to change that but the deed is done already. My depression and anxiety are getting worse as a result so back to therapy I guess.

It's understandable that you might compare yourself to others who seem unaffected by their lifestyle choices, but remember that each person's body is unique, and diabetes can affect people differently.

Additionally, consider joining a support group or seeking counseling or therapy. Talking to others who are going through similar experiences can provide you with a sense of community and understanding.\r  \n\r  \nEducation is also key to feeling more empowered and in control. Take the time to learn about diabetes, its management, and how it affects your body. Your healthcare provider or a certified diabetes educator can be excellent sources of information and guidance.

Focus on activities that bring you joy and help reduce stress.

Your mental health is just as important as your physical health.\r  \n\r  \nDeveloping a diabetes management plan with your healthcare provider will also be immensely helpful. This plan can include dietary changes, exercise routines, medication adjustments, and regular blood sugar monitoring. Collaborating with your healthcare team will provide you with structure and guidance, helping you feel more in control of your condition.\r  \n\r  \nIf your medication is causing unpleasant side effects, don't hesitate to discuss it with your healthcare provider.

What exactly causes damage?,"Newly diagnosed. Say I drank a sprite without taking medication or exercising (I‚Äôm not planning on it but hypothetically speaking).

That could only happen if there was already significant damage.', 'High blood sugars damage internal organs slowly over time, including nerves, so the longer you have high blood sugars, the more damage being done throughout your body.  Failure to get your blood sugars under control will result in more damage.  Once you have nerve damage it is next to impossible to reverse that effect.  It should be a priority to get tight control of your blood sugars to prevent any damage.  There is no cure for type 2 diabetes but it is entirely possible to go into ‚Äòremission‚Äô.', 'One way to look at it, a nondiabetic has an A1C less than 5.7. That can be viewed in laymans terms as 5.7% of your red blood cells have glucose attached to them and are damaged. No worries, red blood cells live like 2 to 3 months. It all works out.

T2DM is a metabolic disease in processing energy, whether that is sugar, fats or protein amino acids. All three have high blood levels in T2DM, although we measure A1c or glucose. \n\nDamage comes from a combination of free radicals from mitochondria, stressed parts in cells where proteins are processed, premature oxidation of fats, especially in blood vessel walls, and gradual decimation of beta cells which must be exposed to glucose coming from the intestines, in order to sense circulating glucose levels. Notice this damage takes place in all cells all over the body - because all cells require energy.\n\nExercise is key because it reduces insulin resistance.

"A1C, Diabetes, Doctors","This is one of the ""do I have diabetes"" posts, but hear me out. When I was younger, I went over to my uncle's for some spaghetti. He's not blood-family, as he married into the family. He has Type 2, and has for years. He shows me his glucose reader, and I'm asking about how it works when he has me try it. We had just eaten not that long ago, and my reading was 145 after eating.He was concerned, and said it shouldn't be that high. I told him that my doctor at the time told me not to worry about that, as I was on a medication that would affect it, and brushed it off. I am since off said medication.

Fast forward roughly 7 years later, and I guess I've noticed some strange things when I eat certain amounts of food, or certain types of food; how my body seems to react, and what it can't handle.

I can recall two times recently where I ate a LOT of sugar (more really than somebody in their 20's should really eat), once I had a huge sundae, and the other time I had a lot of soda and some sour patch kids on top of a huge amount of food. In both cases, I felt very sleepy, and then eventually, I noticed my heart beat faster. I eventually could no longer fight the urge to sleep, and off I went to sleep.Feeling concerned, I called my doctor and scheduled some tests. Eventually, she got me in for a fasting glucose rating, which I didn't do correctly due to having orange juice. My reading was high, in the 120's, but it was considered invalid since I didn't follow the directions. Several months later, I get an A1C blood glucose test, and I read as 5.3% A1C.Despite rating as 200+ when I was in the hospital for throwing up (unrelated, the ER told me, as apparently people produce more blood sugar when they throw up or something, and I had thrown up a lot) and roughly 145 for a result they considered a ""H"" flag, but was essentially ""Not a cause for concern"" for reasons I don't quite understand, I asked my doctor recently if, despite not having a high A1C, if I should be concerned.

She said that my lifestyle could contribute to a future diagnosis, but as of right now, I don't have it.

I don't know -- what do you guys think? Can I trust the doctor here? Should I be concerned?  


Note: During the time before the A1C testing, I had used an at-home test for blood sugar levels, but when I first got the thing I think I may have broken it so I don't trust its results.

Can inflammation from arthritis or knee pain meds with you glucose numbers?,"EDIT: IN TITLE, IT SHOULD BE MESS, NOT MEDS

When I was diagnosed, I had bee pre-T2 for years. I was told what took me over the edge was due in part to a sinus infection I had had for a long time (this was in 2019). I had my normal blood panel, and my liver numbers were high. As it was explained to me, high liver numbers indicate inflammation somewhere, which makes blood glucose go up and then they stair step up.

When my doc saw the combo of triglycerides and liver numbers, he called me in and told me to go to the ER (after explaining what had happened).

Fast forward to this past October. My A1C has been under 6 since 2019. I was having LOTS of diarrhea, so doc says, let‚Äôs take you off the metformin and see if that helps. No more diarrhea. So now, I‚Äôm only on .5 of Ozempic, with on,y 2 more doses and no real prospect for getting more ATM.

For the last week, my hip arthritis has been really bad, and the knee on the other side of the hip is also in pain. My numbers were in the 200-350 at some points during the day. I‚Äôm taking advil and Lyrica for the pain and inflammation as well as a blood sugar supplement with cinnamon, bitter melon, and a couple other things. 

Could the inflammation in my body be dinking around with my sugar again? I‚Äôve been super conscious of hydrating (along with the meds+supplements) and they seem to be, at least first check in the morning, better (150 for the last couple days). I‚Äôm going to check at other moments as well. If I focus on pain relief and stretching to relieve the inflammation, will that help? (I mean I know it will on one hand- any exercise is good, but OTOH, in a vacuum, would reducing pain/inflammation be key?

We are in the US at the moment, and my doctor is in Europe (where we live about half the time). I won‚Äôt be back there before early September, so I‚Äôm kind of on my own here. I‚Äôm watching carbs, exercising, etc.",https://www.reddit.com/r/type2diabetes/comments/14ea62k/can_inflammation_from_arthritis_or_knee_pain_meds/,"['In my experience, inflammation and pain *always* raise my blood sugar.

It‚Äôs Not a Death Sentence,"Was diagnosed in mid March. I see my PCP every 6 months for management of hypertension, and she ordered yearly labs. I‚Äôd always tracked an A1c of 5-6 and fasting glucose of 110-120. High, but it had been my baseline for years so I hung out in a ‚Äúpre-diabetes‚Äù limbo.

On this day, my A1C came back at 10.9 and glucose at 267. I was diagnosed as a type 2 diabetic. 

Started on metformin and Jardiance ($$!!). Changed my diet drastically.  Went to a keto based macros ratio, 70% fat, 20% protein, 10% carb which had worked for me in the past. Lots of fresh meat and veggies (we own a farm so 90% of the meat we eat was raised by us). I dropped 20lbs in the last two months. I was already fairly active from working the farm, but I began to look for something active to do for 20 minutes a day that wasn‚Äôt farm chore related. 

The point of my post is not to say ‚Äúlook what I did!‚Äù But to hopefully inspire other newly diagnosed. When I got the message from my doctor with my diagnosis, I was dejected, depressed, and not optimistic about the future. But by making changes and consistent good choices (with the occasional treat) you can do well.

Shout out to walking,"Just wanted to share a bit of info about how walking really seems to be a game changers for me.  

Since I have gotten my CGM I have been experimenting a little with how food affects me and how walking changes my numbers.  

What I have found is that if I have walked (generally 30 min or more)  and or exercised one day, my numbers start off better the next day.  And stay better for most of the day even if I eat something less than ideal.  

When I don't walk, my numbers start off higher the next day and seem to have to really watch what I eat to keep them good.  

Although I am not advocating walking so you can eat whatever you want, I am just wanting to throw this out here to maybe motivate someone to go for a walk!    I walk and weight train and it definitely is a huge part of keeping my numbers in the normal range!   

I hate walking alone so I have to force myself when i don't have a walking partner but it seems to be a huge part in this (for me at least).

I know some of us aren't able to do a lot of walking but there are a ton of you tube videos that show seated exercise and I am sure that would help with numbers and mobility as well.

"Lifestyle changes , is my diabities reversed","28 M here 180 lbs 174cm

So long story short, since last 5 years my lifestyle have been shit ( lot of booze  1 pack,ciggs and we*d everyday, anxiety issues, shitty sleeping shedule and lot skipping meals, total inactive,and unhealthy processed food ) . I used to be university level powerlifter till 22 but then things changes. 

For last 2 years i was having some of the issues (like repeated yeast infection, Slight ED, numbeness in finger , etc ) went to doctor and my fasting level was 200 !! (That was like 3 months before ) He put me on metforfin and one more med) 

That was moment for change for me and i complete changed myshedule to below 3 months back and quit taking my medicine 

-I started jogging and being physically active (15k steps a day minimum) 
-From binge drinking 12-15 times a month i reduced it to 1-2 times a month. 
-I quit smoking ciggs ( i do vape and blunt here and there)  and improved my sleep shedule alot ( sleep at 11 and wake up at 6 and then long jog for an hour ) 
-my food choices have completely changed and elimnated sugar, fast food and simple carbs to eating lot of feshly cooked healthy food 

Since last two months i check everyday and my fasting blood sugar is below 100 90% time , max it has been 108. Also , post 2 hours of meal bt BG level are below 120 . 

However, there is bit improvement ED but not much and my testorene level are low (200 ng)

New and looking for meter/app advice,"Just a couple weeks into this. Doc set me up with a OneTouch Ultra and basically told me to test as often as I'd like to see what affects my BG. The device works ok, sticking isn't an issue, and it stores results, but I can't see trends and whatever, so I started researching a bit and many of the meters have apps that show more information. I could scroll back through my results on my current meter, but would have to keep a notebook or something and I can't honestly say I'd be good with that.  
There are so many mixed reviews on these meters and the apps.

Right now I'm looking at the Ascensia Contour Next One, or a One Touch Verio Reflect. The test strips are also a consideration as the Contour ones are far less expensive. I do have insurance, and haven't really figured out what my coverage is yet so maybe the recurring cost of supplies isn't that big of a deal.

"How do you ""get your blood sugar under control""?","Okay so I don't understand something, so this may be an ""explain like I'm 5"" situation, because no googling is helping me. I was diagnosed about 6 years ago, but metformin made me feel very sick, so I was NOT very compliant in taking it, and I didn't take my health very seriously until about a month ago because I got a new doctor who's approach was not the ""you take metformin or you have to take insilun"" of my last doctor, but more of ""we are going to try this med, and if it doesnt work for you, we will try something else"" and I'm just like, over the moon about that and I've been med and (decently) eating compliant for a month now. 

So your blood sugar is constantly changing. You eat, you use up glucose, your blood sugar goes up and down. I'm on a couple of medications to try to keep my blood sugar down. Which is great, but my numbers arent where they are supposed to be yet. 

So if blood sugar is so variable by how much you put into and out of your body, can someone explain to me how sticking on this long term will lower my blood sugar more? Or if it does? Or if Ill just need to increase the dose of how much I'm taking UNTIL it's low enough? I think my A1C will be down about a point after the month I've been on these new medications (from 11 to 10, so still VERY bad) but like, if that's the effect of these meds, should I be expecting it to go down more? 

I think I'm eating pretty well, if a bit more of a ""realistic diabetic"" that will still have a slice of pizza when the office is doing it, or cake on my kid's birthday kind of thing. Is eating even more compliant my only option? Will THAT even help as much as I need it to? 

I do have a doctors appointment tomorrow, and I just want to try to understand better so I'm going in with the right questions.

That bread doesn‚Äôt go very far so I take the veggies 95% of the time. By either skipping breakfast or staying as close to no carb as I can, I get more like 25g to play with at lunch and dinner and have basically no spikes.

People with type 2 diabetes already have too much insulin from eating poorly, eating too frequently.  This caused your body to become insulin resistant.  Which causes excess glucose to remain in your blood stream rather than being processed by your muscles or stored as fat.  You can dose yourself with insulin and force the glucose into your body (you will gain weight) but it exacerbates your insulin resistance even further.  But it will temporarily lower your blood glucose... Until your next meal.\n\nSo what's the answer?  You need to take control.  Let your body heal by regulating your eating.  Don't eat sugar or refined carbs that spike your bg.  Intermittent fasting also gives your body time to regulate and lower insulin levels.  Medicine can help, even surgery can help.

Weight and waist size when diagnosed? (along with A1C and fasting),"Three months ago when I was diagnosed, I was 185 and waist of 34 (a1c of 8.1 and fasting of 10.1)

Now, I'm just 160+ and a waist of 32 (a1c of 5.5 and fasting of 4.8) But I'm on medication: 1 metformin twice a day.

I know that everyone's body is different and so people could be heavier or lighter with higher or lower blood sugar numbers, but I'm wondering if it's mainly keeping off abdominal obesity that I will have to do since my doctor allowed me to decrease to 1/2 metformin twice a day. I'm 100% convinced it was where my body was obese that caused diabetes since it was too much fat around important organs, like liver and pancreas. (Sometime in the next few weeks, I'll have to do an ultrasound to see my liver since I might have non-alcoholic fatty liver due to increased liver enzymes)",https://www.reddit.com/r/type2diabetes/comments/149k69z/weight_and_waist_size_when_diagnosed_along_with/,"['I was diagnosed over a decade ago and I have always been thin (ish)....I\'ve lost 10 pounds over that period, but I have never been considered over weight.

A1C went from 7.8 to 5.3. Dr was shocked and changed my diagnosis to pre-diabetic...... That worked for 3-4 years, then came the single metformin....then 2-3 years later, a second metformin..... now as I approach 60 yo, I\'m trying to avoid another med\n\nI\'ve come to the conclusion that it is here to stay and I just need to manage it with exercise and diet.

Some diabetics tend to store fat in their abdomen and around organs, which apparently increases insulin resistance. People with more normal looking arms and legs but also having a gut are more likely to be diabetic than the stereotypical fat person with fat person arms and legs. It‚Äôs something with fat cells not being healthy/functional so the fat gets stored in places it shouldn‚Äôt.\n\nJason Fung has some info about this in his books.', 'what you eat has more effect on diabetes management than anything else. weight loss helps for people who have it to lose', 'Thanks for the details.

As for why it\'s here, the analogy I\'ve liked is that ""genes are the gun, but lifestyle is the trigger"" or something like that. So if I knew that I had a family history of diabetes then I could have taken better care of myself -- but I\'m adopted so I had no idea anyway.\n\nI actually like getting the blood tests every three months since then I can figure out how my body has been handling sugars. If I knew I was diabetic or prediabetic then I could have lost weight sooner since it was always something on my mind -- but it wasn\'t until the diagnosis of Type 2 through blood tests did I take losing weight seriously.

Help,"I was diagnosed a little over 2 years ago with A1c of 8.7 . I started on metFormin and within a few months I was able to get my A1c down to 6.5.

In my experience, doctors would generally be thrilled if their t2d patients dropped their A1C under 6%, and you haven't gone over yet.\n\nYou really don't want to start medication until it's absolutely necessary, anyways. Diet and exercise are almost always better to begin until you reach a point where you can't get things under control without medication. Remember, medications cost money (and they can get expensive), tie you to a pill bottle (or worse, a syringe), can require special storage (insulin/glutides in the fridge), come with side effects (metformin upsets a lot of people's stomachs, glutides have a whole host of potential issues, gliptins can cause UTIs, insulin comes with piles of risks, lows, weight gain, and so on) etc, etc."", 'Yup, got all normal numbers after eating, fasting were the only ones that I received that were somewhat high.

My main concern is just figuring out how much of a lifestyle change I need to make, and I think making more sense of my current numbers could help with figuring that out. The last thing I want is to tie myself to numbers and medicines for the rest of my life.']"
Anyone's doctor tell them to go on less medication?,"On March 2023, I was 180'ish and 33 years old, and had my first blood test and got a glucose fasting of 10.1 and a A1C of 8.1. My doctor put me 1 metformin pill twice a day, that is, one at breakfast and one at dinner. When I first started, I did 1/2 metformin pill twice a day to get my body used to it.

Since then, I'm 160'ish and 34 years old and got a glucose fasting of 4.8 and a A1C of 5.5. Now, to avoid hypoglycemia, my doctor said it was okay to go on 1/2 metformin pill twice a day, and so a full one in a whole day. So I'm back to where I was when I started but now I really have to make sure I keep the sugars down on my own.

Has anyone's doctor told them to go on less medication? And if so, how was it in terms of blood sugar levels? Did anyone go off medication altogether, or did they have to return to the previous amount?

Why is insulin not more common?,"Or maybe I'm misreading the context, but it seems like T2 diabetics don't go on insulin until it's a last resort. Having grown up with a father who's a T1, I was immediately expecting to start an insulin regimen - just to find out I got some low dose oral medications.

I've been wearing a monitor, and for me personally, there's nothing that really spikes me out of range, but my blood glucose basically never goes below 90 and the bigger problem is that it seems like I can stay elevated for hours, even if I exercise.

So, why are we not started on lighter insulin regimens earlier? How else are you supposed to handle going out of range - you're not going to be able to go for a walk every time you're pushing 200, so why is this just considered an ""okay"" risk?",https://www.reddit.com/r/type2diabetes/comments/148osko/why_is_insulin_not_more_common/,"[""This is my understanding and I'm open to being corrected: type 1 is an issue of no insulin so insulin use is required. Type 2 is an issue of poor insulin sensitivity. So our bodies make insulin but have a hard time processing it correctly. By the time we get diagnosed our bodies are already over producing insulin to try to make up for the poor use of it. First line drugs help our insulin sensitivity, not insulin production. If you just jump to giving more insulin, you'll keep on with worsening sensitivity. It's progressive and the amounts of insulin that a type 2 can end up on are staggering because the sensitivity doesn't get corrected so we can end up with a bunch of insulin needed but it not doing much of anything. This leads to other bad things like weight gain, etc."", 'I‚Äôd like to know too! I was started on metformin and it didn‚Äôt work on its own. Was then prescribed Januvia and it made me feel horrible. Then was prescribed ozempic and I hated it! It made me so dehydrated and sickly. Finally asked about insulin and have felt the best I‚Äôve been since diagnosis. Isn‚Äôt it a natural thing our body makes? What‚Äôs the push for these other things with bad side effects and the strictest diet that has bad consequences if you don‚Äôt stick to it perfectly? \n\nI do have type 1.5 which is the autoimmune kind, but was originally misdiagnosed as type 2. I still don‚Äôt get why insulin isn‚Äôt used for type 2 though!', 'Insulin for type 2 will make your diabetes worse.  Your body is insulin resistant because of too much insulin.  If you treat your blood glucose with more insulin it will make things worse, albeit your blood glucose will be lowered temporarily.\n\nDiet and exercise is the most important for type 2\n\nDr Jason Fung explains it well on his YouTube channel.', 'Because study after study has concluded that it is not the best route for type 2. It‚Äôs better than nothing but that‚Äôs it. Diet and exercise are much more effective- if you actually follow it. Instead many choose to not change their ways and take pills, then when those stop working as well, they take more pills or different pills. When that stops working, they start insulin. Then the weight starts piling on and insulin resistance goes up. Then they just take increasing amounts of insulin until enough complications happen. Then game over.\n\nMy dietician repeated the same thing I‚Äôve read in several books. 90%+ of type 2s could stop insulin and most pills if not all by doing a few things- eating low carb, committing to an exercise schedule, and losing 10% of body weight. Most won‚Äôt do this.', 'Type 2 diabetes is just a blanket term, something used to define having an A1C of 6.5% or higher. People fall under a spectrum once diagnosed. This is a complex condition that\'s growing exponentially. The human diet is not meant to be eating highly processed foods and in high volumes.\n\nPersonally, I reflect on what I was eating and my habits pre-diagnosis. I ate whatever I wanted whenever I wanted. Fast food, snacks, ramen noodles, Pringles, soft drinks, sweets, you name it. My sleep schedule was non-existent. Very little to no physical activity, etc. My Dad was diagnosed with Type 2 due to asthma medication...so I already knew I had the gentic material to develop it.\n\nI truly believe it was my eating habits and my body saying that I wasn\'t treating it well that ultimately led me to developing the condition. It\'s an issue of my body not utilizing Insulin correctly not that my body can\'t produce it. Again, Type 2 is just the blanket term, but varying degrees of the condition fall under that unbrella term. There are people who probably have issues with the their liver/pancreas or other condition causing their blood sugar to be high. But a large part of those that fall under the term Type 2 diabetic are more than likely insulin resistant.\n\nWhat they use to determine is blood sugar levels and A1C. What about a test of insulin levels? Someone I know has a normal A1C - 5.4%, but abnormal insulin levels. Although they\'re not diabetic, they need to cautious of potentially developing the condition.\n\nI was able to lower my A1C from 8.6% to 5.6% in 3 months..without medication. Reduction in highly processed carbs and 30 mins of walking is all I did. Was prescribed Metformin, but I didn\'t take it. Dr. said if my #\'s don\'t fall under the normal range, that I would need to start. Lost 45 lbs and am in better health and shape than before I was diagnosed.\n\nI understand that my body may need to be on insulin at some point in my life, but it seems like as they do more research that may not be the case.\n\nMy Endocronologist, Cardiologist, PCP, heck even my Dermatologist all agreed it\'s heavily influenced by diet. My PCP was handling my diabetes and observed my progress. Said, ""you\'re what we call a diet controlled diabetic. You don\'t even need to see an endo in my opinion"". I was like okay, you\'re crazy dude, no way it was as simple as that. So I made an appointment with my endo, first time I met them, after I had gotten my A1C down myself. Told my endo my story and he questioned me about why I was seeing him. I simply answered, ""to get a 2nd opinion."" He said you did everything you were supposed to, you\'ll be fine. He said maybe you can convince my other 5 ppointments I have to do the same thing you did.\n\nThe reason why it\'s ""progressive"" and a growing condition is because they\'re using the wrong treatment and term for something that isn\'t really Type 2.', ""hypos are an acute short term danger (coma!), while highs are a long term danger (heart attack!).\n\ninsulin has the highest risk of hypo of any treatment - so its really best to take the time to see if you can get the long term risks under control with other approaches before going there. There are no other treatments of a T1.\n\nIf you need insulin, we are lucky to have it - I'm not knocking it.. but the danger of hypos is very real."", 'It\'s because T1 and T2 are opposite problems.\n\nIn T1, your cells are starving for glucose.  There\'s plenty of glucose in your blood, but it can\'t get into your cells because there\'s very insulin to let GLUT4 shuttle it into your cells.  As time passes, your cells adapt by becoming more and more insulin sensitive, but there is a limit to this and eventually you\'re going to need to inject insulin to avoid your body wasting away completely.\n\nIn T2, your cells already have all the glucose they want to take on right now, but there\'s still ""extra"" glucose left over in your bloodstream floating around that has to go somewhere.  So your pancreas cranks up insulin production and that helps in the moment, but as your cells get more full they resist even harder.  It becomes a vicious cycle.  If you add more insulin to this by injecting, you only make the vicious cycle worse.\n\nYou might respond ""So what, just inject more insulin then?""  And that\'s a fair question to ask.  But it turns out continually elevated insulin leads to weight gain, increased cancer risk, increased inflammation, high blood pressure, and I\'m sure a dozen other ailments if one dug deep enough in.', ""I don't know for sure but my theory:  \nCost, insurance not wanting to cover it, human error taking too much, people struggle with needles, general docs managing it not having enough education on T2. I'm sure there is lots of other reasons. \n\nBy no means trying to bash general docs in the above statement. Just the general docs (at least in network where I live) know very little specifically about T2 compared to an endocrinologist which makes sense because their schooling was very different."", "">there's nothing that really spikes me out of range, but my blood glucose basically never goes below 90 and the bigger problem is that it seems like I can stay elevated for hours, even if I exercise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDefine elevated if you dont spike out of range"", ""I agree that they often push 'last resort' way too far, forcing people to struggle on medication and diet regimens that aren't working, leaving them feeling frustrated and defeated, and doing long-term damage to their health. \n\nBut, at least part of the hesitation to start insulin sooner than necessary is that it can be super dangerous.  Almost no oral meds lead to scary degrees of hypoglycemia. Insulin can.

Fianc√© newly diagnosed,"I want to preface this by saying that I have type 1 diabetes, and therefore, don't know a ton about type 2. 

My fiance was feeling sick and drinking a ton of water, still complaining of thirst a few days ago. I checked his blood sugar because that set off alarm bells for me. Sure enough, his blood sugar was 404. We waited in the emergency room forever before being seen. 

Eventually, they say he has type 2, gives him a metformin prescription to pick up, and sends him home with a blood sugar of 300. I had had to leave for work a few hours before they released him, so I couldn't advocate on his behalf and make them do something about his blood sugar before sending him home (in an insulin shot.)

But, here's my question. His blood sugar still hasn't gone below 220 since I first checked it Saturday night. I don't really know how metformin works, but I was under the impression that it would help his blood sugar. 

Is there something I'm missing here? Is there something we can do to bring his blood sugar down? The hospital gave us zero resources, and he says no one really explained to him what to do in the case of high blood sugar.",https://www.reddit.com/r/type2diabetes/comments/148ktab/fianc√©_newly_diagnosed/,"['No, metformin does not directly lower blood glucose.

It can only do so much to lower an A1c over time. Diet and exercise are the two key points for managing T2.\n\nIf blood sugar is ""high"" I\'ve found the best way I can bring it down is by running on a treadmill and drinking water as if I\'ve never had any before.\n\nWhile someone who\'s T1 can adjust their insulin, most T2 patients now are not immediately started on Insulin because it can reduce the body\'s ability to restore to a level of proper functionality. So instead T2s adjust the diet, with the focus being on losing weight and reducing the fatty tissue around the liver (I\'ve got a comment in my history explaining the why/ADA scientific stuff about the liver tissue). For me, this has meant using metformin/trulicity, going to the gym 3x a week plus walks with the dog, a low-carb and high-vegetable diet.

Feeling very happy after 6 yrs,"6 years ago I was a morbidly obese t2 diabetic vegan with severe sleep apnea that developed gradually and which apparently is inherited from my late dad. The sleep apnea was so severe it disordered my appetite hormone ghrelin, making me feel starved 24/7 for sugar/carbs (during my vegan years I was always hungry too, but not as bad as with sleep apnea!)

After CPAP treatment my insane craving for sugar/carbs left, and after 1 day of zero appetite, a normal appetite showed up, but this time for beef, eggs, salads, poultry, etc. My sleep dr said my brain is asking for foods with nutrients to repair the damage done by the sleep apnea.

6 yrs ago my a1c was 6.9 and my morning fasting numbers were over 100.

My a1c has been 4.9 for some time now, and my morning fastings are in the 70s. All done without drugs, only proper nutrition and weight loss!

The real shocker for my dr is that I'm a 64 yr old woman.

I keep an excel sheet to show my doctor the difference between regular days and period days but I'm human and forget to screen shot it some nights before I go to bed. I don't like the data gaps lol. 
* I wish the graph was interactive. I'd love to see the peak value from a meal rather than trying to guestimate it. 
* I'd love a logbook data entry that is medication not insulin specifically so I could use it as a double check that I took my medicine. I don't want to confuse my doctor since they can look at it online (not that they ever do unless I'm in the office).

T2 First time to get pregnant,"Got the news last sat... I am 6 weeks pregnant and my Endo changed my med to Insulin pen type injection. I am 35y/o. I am happy about this news but a part of me is really scared of things to come...   
Any advice with this pregnancy? Would really appreciate it!",https://www.reddit.com/r/type2diabetes/comments/1420f4w/t2_first_time_to_get_pregnant/,"[""First off, congratulations! I had my first last year, and overall the pregnancy went well despite having T2D. Since this is a high risk pregnancy, you will have more non-stress tests and ultrasounds in the third trimester than typical pregnancies. I personally enjoyed getting to see the little more often and it was a great way to keep and eye on her size. If you don't already have a CGM, I highly recommend one. It made it so much easier to check my glucose levels 4 times a day while at work. It was also wonderful during labor because they check your glucose every hour üò≥ \n\nI also recommend checking out Real Food for Gestational Diabetes by Lily Nichols. She has some great recommendations for keeping your glucose levels balanced while getting all the necessary nutrients for pregnancy. My diet was nowhere near perfect (hello food aversions), but I was able to avoid using quick acting insulin at meals. \n\nWhen you are on insulin, you can pretty much count on an induction between 37-39 weeks. Mine was at 37 weeks due to gestational hypertension, but my OB and MFM both expected me to have a 38 week induction. Inductions can lead to complications during delivery, but I found that researching the heck out of the process helped me have a great experience. The All About Pregnancy & Birth podcast by Dr. Nichole Rankin has an episode that goes over all of the methods that are commonly used. \n\nThe last piece of advice is regarding breastfeeding, if that is what you are planning on doing. Diabetes affects your body's ability to produce milk. I struggled to produce anything, and when I tried to get a local lactation consultant to help me (baby was also not latching), I couldn't get an appointment for months. For my next pregnancy, I plan to meet with a LC before the birth and soon after so I can have a better chance at breastfeeding.

what even is normal blood sugar levels and reactions?,"TL;DR - less than 3 hours after eating a lot of carbs and even some candy, my blood sugar is only 80. IDK if that's good or bad or other.  


I got diagnosed with T2 like in 2014 or so, I think. didn't know much about it, none of the doctors really gave much advice (pharmacist was more helpful). I just kinda been winging it since then, but tbh mostly neglecting it. I was on insulin initially, then stopped then got back on, then stopped again.

I lost a little over 60lbs in the first half of 2022, on this expensive diet program. This time, my dietary habits have actually change. I literally cannot eat but maybe a little over half as much as I used to eat normally. Spending most of the year on that diet program did reduce my appetite tremendously.

Even before I ate myself into diabetes, I'd been hypoglycemic since at least the early 00s, so I was already familiar with the feeling that you get with low blood sugar. (I didnt even know what it was for a long time, I just knew I would feel very deathly and then pass out if I got too hungry.)

Anyways, in the times when I was paying proper attention to my blood sugar levels, I think I was supposed to aim for 90-120 on the blood-o-meter. (it's been so long since I checked it regularly, the battery on my meter was dead and it wouldn't turn on with a new battery.)

Fast forward to four weeks ago and I begin a new physical fitness routine, pushing really hard. But there were several times where I felt extremely low blood sugar symptoms after working out and once even passed out for a few seconds, so I went to a new doctor to see what's up. I told her the full detailed history that's briefly covered here and what's been going on recently. Doc wanted to get labs and wanted me to get new meter and keep a journal while we waited for the labs (because it was about to be a 3 day weekend in addition to the 48 hour lab turnaround time).  So I did it and I noticed all the times where I felt a low-sugar incident coming on, my blood sugar was in the low 80s. (as it was most mornings when I first got up). Went back to doc when labs came back. She reviewed the labs and my journal. She said looking at the labs alone, if I never told them I was diabetic there's nothing there to make her suspect it. After reading my journal, she said I'm not eating even 1/3 the calories I need for the physical fitness regimen I am in. 

Basically, I'm supposed to stop avoiding carbs at all costs like I mostly have been for the past 18 months. I'm supposed to eat more carbs, more fats, elsewise my body's just going into starvation mode and shutting down instead of burning calories. (is basically what i gleaned from the conversation) Just eat normal, but not foolishly, but get at least 3k calories per day, says the doctor. And that's to lose weight; she said even calories to maintain current weight.

Now, I'm in the opposite position of where I been for most of my life - I'm now supposed to eat more even though I don't want to, instead of wanting to eat way more than I should. It's been more difficult than one might imagine, especially for someone who is so proud of myself for finally beating food addiction after a lifetime of struggling with it. So I went out tonight to go see the new Spiderman movie with the kiddo (excellent movie btw) and we went to a chinese restaurant for dinner before the movie. For the first time in like *forever* I did *not* tell them 'no rice' to go with my mongolian beef. I even ate a bit more than normal (well, my new normal) as well. At the movies, I even got butter on the popcorn and candy. 

So the movie, was 2.25 hours long and it's a 30 minute drive home, so that's just under 3 hours after eating 'all those carbs' from the rice and maybe 2 hours since I stopped eating buttery popcorn and chocolate mints when I got home to check my blood sugar. - *My blood sugar is only 80 right now*. I expected it to be at least like 115-120ish. After all that. I feel fine, but recent experience says I should be feeling super bad (low sugar).

 \^-- Is this normal? Like how can it be that low so soon after I ate all that junk and haven't even done any physical activity besides casual walking today? Or is that just normal for ppl who are not diabetic?

Alternatives to GLP-1 meds,"Hi gang - I have an appt with my endo tomorrow morning.  I'm struggling with getting my overall BG lower, even with various oral meds .and improving lifestyle changes.

My new endo has recommended trying Trulicity or Ozempic at last visit.  I was put on both a few years ago, and had really bad negative side effects on both, so I'm petrified to try again.  Basically, I'd spend 3-4 nights a week, waking up in the middle of the night with severe nausea, abdominal pain and vomiting (gastroperesis).

How do you say no to lunch with your boss or restaurant tips,"I work for a very small company. I know my boss is just being nice and I do appreciate how great of a boss he is. But he is always wanting me to go to lunch with him to places that are not low carb friendly. I bring my lunch every day and eat while I work so I can walk as my lunch break. That lunch walk has done wonders to my A1C, weight, and mental health. I walk sun, rain or snow no matter what. Even when I tell my boss I brought lunch he tells me to save it for tomorrow. 

I know one meal won't ruin all my progress but if I'm going to eat a meal that isn't low carb I want it to be something I actually enjoy, and can have some veggies before so I don't feel terrible after. 

Since I'm in the prediabetic range I've chosen not to tell anyone at work about it (mostly because I don't want the unsolicited advice from a *particular* coworker). Really if I got sick they would call my husband, who very much understands my situation, and only works 10 minutes away. 

Is there a polite way to say no to going to lunch? I feel like I run higher for at least a day and a half after I eat out.

If you are going to say suck it up please give me some tips for eating at a restaurant. Asian food specifically since that is my boss' favorite.

Thank you for understanding.""\r  \n\r  \nAs for tips on eating at a restaurant, particularly when it comes to Asian food, I can certainly help! It can be tempting to indulge in rice and noodles, but there are ways to navigate the menu while still enjoying your meal. Here are a few suggestions:\r  \n\r  \n1. Choose dishes with lean protein: Look for options that include grilled or steamed chicken, fish, or tofu. These can provide a satisfying source of protein without adding excessive carbs.\r  \n\r  \n2. Emphasize vegetable-based dishes: Opt for stir-fried or steamed vegetables as a side dish or as part of your main course. Vegetables can add volume and nutrients to your meal while keeping carb intake lower.\r  \n\r  \n3. Request modifications: Don\'t hesitate to ask the restaurant if they can accommodate your requests. For example, you can ask for extra vegetables instead of rice or noodles or request that sauces be served on the side, allowing you to control the amount you consume.\r  \n\r  \n4. Be mindful of portion sizes: Asian restaurants often serve generous portions, so consider sharing a dish with a colleague or asking for a to-go container to save half of the meal for later. This can help you manage your overall carb intake.\r  \n\r  \n5. Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of water throughout the meal, as it can help you feel satisfied and prevent overeating.\r  \n\r  \nRemember, it\'s all about finding a balance that works for you. While one meal won\'t derail your progress, being mindful of your choices and making informed decisions can help you stay on track with your health goals. And if there\'s ever a time when you decide to indulge a little, do so without guilt and enjoy the experience. Your commitment to your health is commendable, and it\'s important to acknowledge the progress you\'ve made so far.', ""'I dont like the taste of soy sauce, i find it too salty'.\n\nYou're welcome."", 'Just explain everything you wrote here to your boss, I know she/he will understand and maybe you can find a good solution together', '‚ÄúMy Doc said I have to give up the good stuff.‚Äù  Followed by a suggestion for a restaurant with better options.', ""I'd recommend giving as little detail about your health as possible to an employer, leaving it as 'im on a diet' main reason is as nice as your boss is there never your friend"", 'There a million dishes that don‚Äôt have soy sauce', ""Generally I keep my heath stuff private from any employer.

T2 Diabetic (Need some help with diet plan),"I'm needing some help in finding a diet plan.  I'm a Type 2 diabetic. I was diagnosed in July of 2022. I managed it for a while. . My A1C was 7.6 then, it dropped to 6.1.  In February, I went off the deep end. .

I was suppose to have had shoulder surgery yesterday morning, but my blood sugar was 371 (even though I had not ate or drank anything since 10pm the night before.  They cancelled it on the spot.  I was pissed until I found out there was high risk for complications. . . Well I got home about 45 minutes later and checked my sugar thinking that their sugar machine was screwed up. . Nope, it wasn't. . Mine showed 502. It had rose that much in less than an hour.

So I called my PCP (I don't have an endocrinologist local). He got me in several hours later. (He chewed my butt, but i deserved it).

He put me on Metformin 500mg (1 pill per day for a week), then on the 8th day, I will go up to 2 daily. And he also put me on a new sliding scale. . . I've only ate twice today, and my sugar is still over 250.

Ozempic for scrawny Type 2 diabetic,"
Hi - I‚Äôm wondering if there are others with my experience and can share advice. I‚Äôm a relatively scrawny and somewhat athletic 46 year old who was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 10 years ago. Both my parents have it and genetics have played a big part. I‚Äôve tried to keep my A1C down with diet and exercise but I‚Äôve really struggled to keep it in a healthy range. I‚Äôm currently on 2000 mg of Metformin per day and my doctor had me start Ozempic last week to try and keep my A1C down. I‚Äôm trying the new med but Im worried that beyond the other side effects that I will lose a crazy amount of weight and get scary thin. Right now I‚Äôm 155 lbs and 5‚Äô8. I could probably lose 10lbs more but if I lose anymore then that I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôll look emaciated. So far on Ozempic I have almost no appetite and whenever I try to force myself to eat I feel a bit queasy. I‚Äôm only on the .25 dose and in a couple weeks I‚Äôm supposed to go up to .50. 

Has anyone else had a similar experience/concern with losing too much weight? Do you know if staying on the .25 dose can help your A1C? I‚Äôll of course ask follow up questions to my doc but I just  thought I‚Äôd check here first.

Food that I eat has no impact on my fasting number at this point even if I have a piece of birthday cake or a serving size of anything but I havent tested extensively and typically eat the same things daily.  However the last 2 months I've been having a terrible time sleeping since my spouse got a new job and wakes up at 430 and I wake up and go to sleep again and each time my fasting number gets more and more into prediabetes territory when it was previously very normal (85 to 100 typically, sometimes down to 70s sometimes up to 105 during period).  \n\nIt could be because I've also been taking a supplement to help with how the body uses insulin (inositol) and is supposed to regulate hormones (trying to get pregnant) and blood sugar but it also may be responsible for my sleep issues.  Imo make sure you're getting a good night's sleep if diet isnt the issue!  Yesterday I woke up with a 90 fasting but I only woke up once for 5 mins and got up at 730am like normal.  Today I woke up with a 120 fasting when I finally got out of bed (top 3 highest fasting readings) but I woke up at 430am then was up for an hour, fell back asleep, woke up for another hour, fell back asleep and woke up and laid in bed till 10am mad that my sleep was so poor.  I ate the exact same thing and got the same amount of activity both days.  I've experimented when this previously happened and found the first time I wake up my fasting is normal but each time I go back to sleep it gets higher and higher vs if I just get up it the first time it doesnt keep going up or if I dont eat during the day it stays around the same unless it gets too low then it goes up a bit on it's own.  \n\nTheres plenty of options you can try for managing blood sugar if you are not overly impaired via doing different things with your lifestyle to see if you can improve that number.  I see a naturopath (nd) along with my md.  But I'd be careful with any supplements if you have kidney disease and make sure you talk to the proper authority on the subject etc etc \n\nI hope it all works out well for you!""]"

I'm confused by how much to test,"I just don't know how often to test my blood sugar. My diabetes educator and doctor did not give me any recommendations - they actually referred to each other.

Do I need to adjust my Humalog?,"I started on insulin a few months ago to get ready for IVF, and still kind of adjusting to the process.

I'm sick of food.,"Food is driving me crazy. I am focusing on keeping my blood sugar below 140 at all times so I don't eat a lot of carbs. I eat some but never alone. I don't eat a lot of saturated fat because I have familial high cholesterol. I am on zetia which does ok and I can't take statins. 

My doctor just told me I am losing weight too quickly on Ozempic and need to slow down. It is making my fatty liver worse (blood test) and I could get gallstones in my liver (gallbladder removed 5 years ago). I honestly don't know what to eat to be healthy anymore. 

I saw a nutritionist and she told me to become a vegan. That's not going to work for me. 

I am trying to eat more but Ozempic is pretty much demands small meals. I was eating 1000 calories a day but doctor said I need to eat more. 

What can I eat that is calorie dense low in carbs and low in saturated fat and is healthy? I've eaten so many nuts and peanut butter I'm going to be ill looking at more. At this point I am just going to eat ice cream (insert sarcasm here).

Getting numbers and diet in order,"I have had type 2 for going on 3 years now.

I've had my ups and downs with it. At first I was able to get what I felt were good numbers (in the 100s-115s and occasionally down to 90s) on good diet, exercise and MetFormin.

At some point my depression and anxiety kicked in heavily, and I was no longer able to keep up with the same level of diet and exercise and my numbers went back up. When getting back on a more proper diet (though not as strict as before) didn't help, the doctor upped my dosage. The side effects became very bad, and I was transferred into Pioglitosone.

&#x200B;

Since then I've moved to the UK and gotten married, and still have not been able to keep up with the strictness of the diet and exercise routines I had back when I was very first diagnosed.

My numbers when I wake up tend to be at about 10.3/185.

Lately I've been having oatmeal for breakfast. 1 teaspoon each sugar and cinnamon, half a pink lady apple. Just yesterday I started adding in pumpkin seed and pecan to it as well. I'll usually then spend between 30 minutes and an hour walking at a slow pace around my room.

But two hours after eating, my blood sugar will be at 13.5/243+.

I'm not consistant with lunch or dinner, some days it'll be a nice sized salad, some days it'll be a hamburger. Every day I have a latte with an unmeasured amount of flavored full sugar syrup in it.

At that point I'll walk around my room again, and when I'm feeling up to it, do a small handful of leg lifts to attempt to work on my core muscles.

Two hours later, my blood sugar will be down to 9.3/167. 

Dinner is the same as lunch- sometimes I have some nice healthy veg, sometimes it'll be a big bowl of pasta.

But by bed time, my blood sugar has returned to what it is at fasting/wake up- 10.3/185.

&#x200B;

I'm thinking it has to be the oatmeal, but I was eating it to make certain I was full all morning rather than feeling the need to snack, but the numbers are upsetting to say the least.

My most recent check up with my doc, she was concerned about my fasting blood glucose and sent me to an endo.

I went to the endo today who looked at my numbers and said ""You don't need me, you've reversed your diabetes."" She told me I can try going off my metformin, which is the only med I've ever taken.

I wasn't expecting to hear that, I'm was worried that 5.7 isn't low enough or that I should lose 10-15 more pounds. And my sugar does still spike if I eat carbs in the AM. I thought reversal was if you eat food, your blood glucose responds like a normal person.

Now I'm just confused, lol. I'm afraid that since I'm in prediabetes that if I go off the metformin, it will put me back in diabetic numbers range. Has anyone with a similar A1C gone off metformin successfully and kept the A1C down?

You might keep improving as you keep it well controlled, but using the term 'reversed' is somewhat misleading. What you are doing is controlling it well with diet to the point that you are basically within normal ranges. Currently you are also using metformin to do that. Now the Endo's opinion is that the next goal is that you are low enough that you can control it with just diet alone and not taking metformin.\n\n It's one of those cases where you are doing well and so just keep doing what you have been doing. If your glucose results start to rise or become difficult to control when you don't take metformin, or if your A1c starts to go up, you would want to message them and see what they say. They would likely have you start taking metformin again if that happens..\n\n My dad has been off metformin for years.

Dramatic weight loss,"My father recently moved in with me after living in another state for 10 years. I was only able to see him like once every few years. About 4 years ago, he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes despite being at a normal weight and generally healthy. Right before his diagnosis he started losing weight and it continued after. Truth be told, he never really did well with keeping up with his medication, checking his blood sugar, or staying away from the sugar and carbs. We both believe he has an actual sugar addiction or something because he has a hard time saying no and sticking with the right things to eat. He is 56 and has worked his entire life as a commercial plumber, not like plunging toilets or whatever, but putting entire buildings pipe systems in. In January he was let go at his job and his health only got worse and I told him to come and live with me so I could help him get healthy. He has been hospitalized multiple times with blood sugars of 500 plus. When he was diagnosed 4 years ago he was around 150 lbs and he is now 93 pounds. He has lost all his teeth. I have NEVER seen type 2 diabetes do this to someone but the doctor says its because it was so poorly controlled. It really scares me sometimes how dramatic the change has been. He is now more determined to get healthy and he takes glipizide (sp?) and metformin daily. His blood sugar is still high a lot of the time, but not as bad as it was. The issue we are having is he can not gain weight. He eats 3x a day and is taking in calories but says he still feels malnourished and will even get dizzy sometimes.

diabetes meds long term use effects?,"Hey. I am part of a diabetes group on Facebook (red flags) who say being on meds long term means I'll be on more t2 diabetes meds later.

I just take metformin 2x a day and jardiance. I exercise 6x a week and I eat.... Way better than I did but not always the best. Down 60 lbs. My a1c was 5.4 last check.

Of course the members of this ""way of eating"" low carb group send me youtube videos about how I am going to kill all the cells that help me with diabetes.  I've tried to Google but can't find good sources to know.

It important to note that with SGLT-2 inhibitors such as Jardiance a ketogenic diet is contraindicated and can hasten a serious side effect known as DKA and land you an inpatient status in hospital. So although keto diets are popular for weight loss this approach is not recommended based on research studies. Furthermore be careful of unexpected severe dehydration while taking Jardiance. You are essentially recommended to have water or other hydration in your hands almost at all time.

Been over 10 yrs‚Ä¶.,"I‚Äôve been a type two diabetic for over 10 years. I never really took it seriously until I had a heart attack in 2018. I was able to get my blood well under control down to an A1c of 5.5 and lose almost 100 pounds of weight. However, since the pandemic, my blood skyrocketed to an A1c of 8.9 and I put on about 40 pounds in the last year and a half. I‚Äôve begun working out steadily again as I had in the past biking almost 45 miles a week. Unfortunately, I also fall victim to carbs. I‚Äôm one of those people that eat out of depression and sadness. I don‚Äôt make excuses for it. It‚Äôs simply the reason that it occurs. Recently. I‚Äôve noticed a couple of things that are very different about my blood sugar than it was in the past.
1) my blood sugar even after fasting for eight hours is over 180, almost always, after I‚Äôve gotten up. After I have a salad for lunch, within a couple hours my blood sugar drops to about 130-150. Why is this occurring?
2) I like to get a good workout when I‚Äôm cycling, usually I do 8 miles and I can usually pull it off in about 35 to 45 minutes. My blood sugar is always spiking after a bike ride, I‚Äôm assuming because of adrenaline. How long does it take for the adrenaline to go down so that I can take my blood sugar after working out? Does the adrenaline go away pretty quickly?
3) why am I getting the spike in blood sugar after a workout? For 3 to 4 years before the pandemic I could work out for an hour which included weightlifting, as well as a steady pace 3k run, and my blood sugar would actually drop to between 90 and 100. What on earth has happened that my blood sugar is spiking after a work out now rather than going down?

Journalist looking to talk to people about treatment with Ozempic,"Hi guys, I'm a health journalist and I'm currently working on a project about Ozempic being used in patients with and without type II diabetes. I'm hoping to talk to people about their experiences taking this medication, in order to foster a greater understanding of how these medications affect people (especially those with type II diabetes) and what sorts of side effects (if any) are commonly experienced.

Anyone else?,"This is long.....I've been overweight for the last 10 years, but had normal numbers at my yearly health checkups/bloodwork. My fasting glucose in spring of 2021 was the highest it had ever been, at 110. Somehow, between that spring and December of 2021, I went from 110 to 380. Had lost 14 lbs without trying, always sleepy and thirsty, peeing a lot. Was diagnosed type 2. I cut out all the main carbs, sugars etc. Basically ate lazy keto style for months, while taking 1000 MG metformin, walking....glucose slowly came down and I'd have fasting of around 130. A1c dropped from 12 to 5.7 in 3 months. I became more lenient with diet for sanity, but still didn't eat the main carbs. A1c was 5.5 at next Dr checkup. I stopped walking, have dealt with depression, and occasionally have carby things for last few months. I mean like a slice of ezekial toast with 2 eggs and some avocado, and a small apple with sugar free peanut butter. I will cut a micro slice of pie some weekends, to get a taste. I'll have a few croutons on salad, or have a few small hush puppies. Not daily though. I realized sugar alcohols were spiking me up high, and have cut those. But when my glucose goes up, it stays up....for days. I've increased MetFormin to 2,000 MG per day, a few months ago, and I will stay around 300 or so for a while day and night.

They say 15% loss of body fat can aid remission.

I still have 40 to go but it's just not coming off.\n\nMy ldl went up 50% 10 months after I changed my diet but my doctor said not to worry that ldl isnt a single marker of health and that i didnt need meds.  All my other numbers went down and my ldl cholesterol appeared to go up which was abnormal compared to most who eat this diet.  I also tried to see if lowering saturated fat would make a difference and my ldl actually went up 10mg when I started replacing it with more olive and avocado oil than I'd previously had so now I just est the sat fat and figure it will come down eventually since it's been such a big help in my mood.  Either way doctor said a1c matters more than  ldl for heart disease risk!  But obviously I'm not a doctor etc etc.  My trig to hdl ratio which is a bigger indicator of heart risk is pretty good though like my triglycerides are between 55 and 62 and my hdl is in normal range and it's possible that ratio is a bigger factor than the ldl but idk.  All we can do is our best.  Like i said for most people when they do the keto style diet their cholesterol actually goes down.  Also removing vegetable oil was a big help in my hunger/appetite as well.\n\nMy dad was on insulin for 20 to 25 years and his doctors recommended keto to him.  Well he didnt know to adjust his insulin and within a week he was getting serious lows and it scared him off the diet which is a shame since it clearly helped. He never lost a lb since diagnosis and has recently been prescribed ozempic now and lost 65lbs and requires much less insulin (he used to take a ridiculous amount) but he still eats whatever he wants and his a1c is 6.5 now at 73.  Last time I saw him he was eating a full sized chocolate easter bunny üôÑ\n\nHonestly making the lifestyle change comes when you're ready.  That fear you talk about drove me to make the changes I needed to make.  Also sleeping on a scheduale was big.  With the under 50g total carbs my diagnosed eating disorder (mostly binge) resolved on it's own.  I no longer was a pit of endless hunger and emotionally eating.  Adding a lot of saturated fat and protein in my first meal of the day basically carried me to dinner and really improved my mood, mental health, anxiety, digestive issues and skin quality.  For the walking I started smaller and definitely slow like less than 2mph.  \n\nIf you had kids you could take them for walks with you.  My dad had a heart attack at 46 and walked for awhile and we would go with him and those times are really memorable for me.  Hes mostly been completely sedentary though and no more heart issues at least *knock on wood*.  Try the walk after your dinner just go slow and enjoy it and see if it helps :) you just gotta find what you can fit in your life that works for you.  Maybe get a dog and you can do 2 walks a day with kids right there!  Or a walking pad is much cheaper than a treadmill and you can just stroll in front of the tv.  Even try walking in place doe an episode if a sitcom infront of the tv and see if that helps.  \n\nEstablishing routine was the key for me.  I went from eating fast food and doughnuts for all my meals and walking less than 500 steps a day (literally to the door to get food and the bathroom) to exercising 5 days a week and eating a whole food diet and I'm someone who had no self control or ability to commit to anything lol.\n\nI have solutions for everything because in my life I've made every excuse.  Truthfully the house could be cleaner sometimes but your life matters more and there will always be something to work on or be better at.  I ended up making scheduale for stuff and if I miss one day I will get it the next week I dont punish myself by having it all pile up on the next day.  Maybe your short walk could be a breather from the kids or time just for you.  Sometimes we dont make ourselves enough a priority ‚ô°\n\nSorry for the giant reply dont feel compelled to reply to all of it lol I just know it's hard to start but honestly at 40 I'm so much healthier now in some ways than I was at 25 or 30.""]"

I was testing 6x a day with my ReliOn meter and I took a reading just be for my lab and it was surprisingly close. 105 vs the lab's 108.

Congrats on the lower numbers!"", 'I have used the Freestyle Libre 2 and now use the 3. I have had a few bad sensors and after talking with [Abbott customer support](https://www.freestyle.abbott/us-en/support.html) they have told me that if a sensor if off by >30% in the first 24 hours or >20% after the first 24 hours contact them and they will send you a replacement sensor.', ""Libre are shit imo.  I had the same thing happen where the alarm would wake me and I'd check and I was no where near in a low situation.  I called Abbott many times and they finally said that the sensor could be damaged in shipping and cause the sensor to be off.  I got so anxious with it on that my Diabetes Educator told me to take it off.  I have 3 in my closet now and won't use them again"", ""That happened to me last week with my first sensor. Changed it out and it's all good now. The stories of bad sensors are very true""]"
Meal Delivery Kits,Hi - does anyone in the US have any recommendations on meal delivery services for people with type 2 diabetes?,https://www.reddit.com/r/type2diabetes/comments/138uv21/meal_delivery_kits/,"['[deleted]', 'I used to get Home Chef meals and select the low carb options. I never had a high reading and they were pretty flavorful! That was 2 years ago though so not sure if the quality anymore. Usually some influencer has a discount code though! I have been considering trying them again.', ""Most of the meal delivery kits have low carb/keto options. They should all work fine for you. Green Chef allows you to choose your meals, but you do have to cook them. They don't come pre-packaged"", 'I just signed up for them as I realize I am not eating healthy enough. We‚Äôll see how it goes, it‚Äôs expensive.', 'Thanks! Yes to mushrooms and no to seafood though. Not eating seafood is so hard on these diets.', 'Yes they are super good. I don‚Äôt have a microwave and use and oven still really good.', 'Thanks!', 'Thank you.']"
My retinopathy experience.,"I've been dealing with some diabetic retinopathy issues for the last month+ and thought I'd share my experience with y'all.  

Potential trigger warning for some eye trauma...

&#x200B;

1. Got some black floaters in my vision in one eye.  They were opaque, and obtrusive, but ultimately, if that had been it, it's something I could've learned to live with.  But that wasn't it.  
2. My first ophthalmologist appointment - abnormal blood vessels are causing the floaters.  I get an injection in my eye that's supposed to subdue the blood vessels and keep it from worsening.
3. A couple days later, it worsens.  Other than the floaters, I'm now getting some blood ""loose"" in my eye, clouding it significantly.
4. Next ophthalmologist appointment - I get some laser work done that's supposed to be even better at subduing those blood vessels.  The clouding blood is still a problem.  It may reabsorb in time, it may not, so they schedule me for one more check-in to see how it's doing as well as a potentially surgery date to ""suck"" that excess out.
5. Check-in appointment - the lasering seems to have worked, but the issue with the excess blood is still there.  
6. Surgery - they have to go into my eye and do some work.  In the process, a gas bubble is pumped in to help keep pressure against my retina to make sure it stays in one piece and attached.  Because tears and separation are a legitimate risk.
7. My vision in that eye is now worse than ever though I don't have the ""floaters"" anymore. This is expected of course, but after several weeks of visits and waiting and visits, I'm not in the best place mentally.
8. Another appointment - the gas bubble is shrinking, but there's still some excess blood in my eye.  This time, it's more reasonable, just a trace of it residual from the surgery, not the abnormal vessels, and it should fade.
9. I have another appointment tomorrow, 8 weeks since this started.  I expect it to go well.  

I guess the moral of the story is - see a retina specialist regularly.  If they can catch some minor retinopathy early enough, and laser it before it becomes a problem, your life will be MUCH easier.",https://www.reddit.com/r/type2diabetes/comments/137zw2s/my_retinopathy_experience/,"['>I guess the moral of the story is - see a retina specialist regularly.

I am sorry you are having this difficulty.\n\nIn my own case after I gained control of my blood glucose levels my ophthalmologist was surprised to find I had scarring from previous retinopathy which had healed. A few years later he could not find the old scars.', 'What was your a1c?', 'All the best, I‚Äôve been getting the injection of vabysmo I‚Äôve had 3 in each eye so far and luckily that has worked so far. Some irregularities in my vision and am currently waiting for my glasses to come. Last optometrist appointment they said my eyes looked good and am due to see the specialist later this month I think the best thing I‚Äôve done to help is get my A1c from 11 to an estimated 6 waiting for follow up blood test but that has helped slow progression for me', 'I‚Äôm so sorry to hear that and glad that you‚Äôre better now. May I know whether your BG is under control the whole time or not?', 'So I am absolutely way to scared to do a needle to the eye, did they do anything to help when you went for this procedure?', 'Thank you for sharing your retinopathy experience. I am also a type 2 diabetic and have an ophthalmology Appt this month. My optometrist said that cataract on my right eyes are almost ready for surgery. Thanks again for sharing your experience l‚Äôll take a note of it.', 'Its been around 6 to 6.5 for the last year or so.', 'My A1c has been fine for the most part.  My daily  glucose has had some jumps, but is still mostly controlled.', 'Yeah, its not a big deal, you cant really see or feel it happening.', ""Yep, Im developing cataract issues as well.  The surgery I just had has made it worse in that eye as well.  Ill likely get that sorted before summer's out.""]"
