Thanks for reminding me on my trip,,https://i.redd.it/ckioo1a3d7bb1.jpg,[]
"sometimes, it IS the insulin","ive been having the week from hell. nothing was acting according to past experience, my spikes were huge, prebolus times needed to be 3 times as long and insulin usage almost doubled across the board and seemly less effective. corrections didn't seem to touch my spikes and then suddenly everything would come crashing down leaving me with prolonged urgent lows. i was starting to feel extremely overwhelmed and lost, like i didnt know how to care for myself anymore. 
everything online and every t1d group said it could be a million different things but it was unlikely the insulin was bad, even though I had a prolonged power outage a month ago.
well i picked up a new box of insulin this morning and everything went back to how it was before.

Having a hard time,"I just got diagnosed with T1 2 months ago and i‚Äôm finding it really hard to deal with. Just small things that happen in everyday life remind me that I can never live like i used to, and watching people go through their day without having to worry about blood sugar or what they‚Äôre going to eat next. I‚Äôve also gained a lot of weight since my diagnosis, I‚Äôm still a teenage girl and so this has affected me mentally so much since ive always been underweight yet conscious of my weight. Its just all too much to handle and no one around me understands at all and i feel like a burden whenever i talk about my diabetes to them. I just want to be able to talk to someone",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14vsbv7/having_a_hard_time/,"[' ï„Å£‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ î„Å£\n\nThis disease sucks, but your RedditFam loves you, and knows you will make it! Lonely\\_Influence\\_356 is right - it is different for everyone, but once you start getting it down, it does get easier!\n\nYou will get this, you will do great, we believe in you!', '7 months after diagnosis here at age 26 and I promise you I felt exactly what you\'re feeling, I was so hopeless 5 months ago.\n\nThe closest thing I can compare it to is like losing a loved one. It will always hurt but everyday it gets a little easier.\n\nIf I could give you any advice it would be:\n\nCalm down your life right now and focus on yourself, you have a lot to learn and a lot to process, take each day calmly and relax your mind/body. Meditate, play video games, whatever the fuck relaxes you, do it. Don\'t blame yourself or get frustrated, this isn\'t your fault and you\'re going to get it. It\'s like riding a bike or learning a language it takes time but you just have to stick at it. There are no shortcuts or ways to avoid dealing with this illness, this is something I learned the hard way.\n\n\nAlways be prepared. This just means have hypo snacks EVERYWHERE in your life and on you at all times. Also keep your insulin and supplies stocked up and on you when you need them.\n\n\nLearn about your diabetes, find out your ratio for bolusing, find out how different foods and exercise affect you. Don\'t worry about spikes or numbers too much as long as it\'s not a low or super high, just wait 3 hours to let everything work and see where you\'re at then, you\'ll make lots of mistakes and know for next time. Trial and error is the only way to find consistency.\n\n\nLastly, and this one is hard, you need to accept that nobody but other type 1\'s are going to ""get"" it. My wife has seen me at my best and worst with this and she always says even though she gets it, she will never ""get"" it because it\'s not her and she doesn\'t know how I deal with it. I never grew up with this so my family and friends haven\'t got a clue, I felt crappy for months wishing I could talk to them or they\'d ask more about it and stuff. The truth is these people don\'t know what the word \'bolus\' means, let alone understand and empathize with the daily constant struggle of a really complex illness. Speak to anyone who is compassionate about it but keep it simple, ""doing good right now"", ""couple tough days recently"", ""working on controlling it better"" and leave it at that. Seek out T1 support for real talk, this community is great, come here everyday and we will all support one another whether you\'re struggling after 2 months or someone is struggling after 60 years.\n\nJust please trust me when I say that you\'ve got this. Get knocked down and keep getting back up, it will all click into place for you, your time is coming.', 'Hi, I was diagnosed less than 2 years ago and I was suicidal because of it. It really could not have happened at a worse time in my life. People would always tell me I‚Äôd reach a place more zen and more competent with handling this illness. I‚Äôm still not there, but I‚Äôm always working toward it. Some days still REALLY suck. But when I think about how I‚Äôve built my life around it, and my confidence in managing it compared to where you are now, at the 2 month mark? Holy shit I‚Äôm proud of myself. If it makes you feel better, I gained about 30 pounds after diagnosis. Once I got situated on a pump and CGM, the weight fell right off. I‚Äôm back to where I was. One day at a time! And if today sucks, tomorrow will certainly come.', ""Being diagnosed T1D is a major life event, akin to parenthood, death, etc. There is a before and an after. Your life is different now and it has been permanently changed. Allow yourself time to grieve, it's normal to feel sad, angry and scared. When T1D gets me down, I find it helpful to focus on the things I can control (how much do I know about my disease, who is on my medical team, which meds I take, delivery systems like pumps and CGM, daily maintenance, diet, activity, etc.) and not on the things I can't control (why me, there is no cure, I might get horrible complications, etc.) Stay in the moment. Take it one day at a time right now. You are not alone and you can do this. ‚ù§Ô∏è"", ""Make full use of places like this to talk and learn, most T1 are diagnosed in 10 -15 years old age and  it's a lousy time with hormones and everything associated with change from childhood to young adulthood.

I was diagnosed at 17. I'm nearly 42 now. life isn't the same as a non diabetic, but if you prepare yourself you can pretty much still lead a normal life. It's annoying and a constant job, but don't sweat the small stuff. You'll go low, you'll go high. You'll wake up sweating in the middle of the night, eat your entire fridge, go back to sleep, wake up and ruin your BG for the rest of the day. But so what, as long as you're in control. Don't let 1 low or 1 high spike get you down. Just get your levels back right amd carry on doing the best you can.

I\'ve found that I\'ve been able to go back to doing everything I was before but it always takes extra effort beforehand to organise. I have never been a planner so this has been a really maturing experience for me! If u can develop this skill, it will all feel a lot easier.\n\nIf ur interested, the main things I think about are: Always carrying my insulin; Making sure I\'ve got fast-acting sugar on me (both liquid and lolly form); Always carrying a low-carb snack; Thinking about what food is going to be available wherever I\'m going; If im doing exercise, ensuring I have a complex carb like muesli or bread an hour beforehand.\n\nOh and on the eating thing, my appetite coming out of hospital was crazy. I put on like 6kgs in about 10 days and I\'ve put on another 6 in the last few weeks. But it has started to lessen recently now that I\'m doing all my ""normal"" things again. This might happen to you? Also, stress can cause weight gain so maybe once you feel more on top of it all, your body will start going back to how it was before!', 'First off, I‚Äôm so sorry that you have to deal with this now. It does truly suck. I was diagnosed 20 years ago shortly after my 12th birthday.. There‚Äôs no sugar coating it. BUT‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

And I caused my body loads of irreversible damage that I‚Äôm trying to slow down now‚Ä¶ doctors told me over and over again the damage I was doing and I never listened to them. I wish I would‚Äôve. I spent a lot of time in the beginning thinking ‚Äúwhy me?‚Äù And it didn‚Äôt do anything for me to always be sad about it and resent life because of it. Everything in your life changes and it does fucking suck. But you‚Äôll learn things along the way that‚Äôll make it manageable. You‚Äôll have good days and bad days. Don‚Äôt dwell on the bad. You can literally eat the same thing everyday. Wakeup at the same time everyday. Do the same tasks everyday. And your blood sugars will never be the same everyday. This community has helped me immensely. Knowing I‚Äôm not the only one who isn‚Äôt the picture perfect cookie cutter diabetic helps a ton. Be kind to yourself ‚ô•Ô∏è SOMETIMES‚Ä¶. I tell myself‚Ä¶. I ended up with this dumb ass disease‚Ä¶ because I was strong enough to be able to deal with it.', ""It's hard, but it also gets better. I was diagnosed about 5 months ago and took it like a death sentence, quit my PhD, felt like I couldn't do anything. Then it became more normal, I applied a lot of brain power to figuring out what works for me, getting my ratios down, getting a sensor. Last month I ran a half marathon, something I would have never believed I could do when I was first diagnosed. I'm not saying it isn't hard, or that there aren't sacrifices, but you are really only as limited as you make yourself. We can do (almost) anything with a bit of prep work. There are days and weeks where nothing will make sense, where you struggle. When it's like that, come here and complain, talk shit, look at memes.

We may not know each other personally but we're all in a similar boat and there is enough collective experience to help guide you when you're in need. It's gonna be rough for a little while but you will find your ground. After almost 30 years I can't even imagine a life without keeping track of blood sugar, what I eat, how active I am..all these things I do every day are almost pure instinct at this point. If they were to cure me tomorrow I dont know if I could stop checking my sugars every day. Like it just doesn't compute with me anymore.

This is a good place to talk about it tho!', ""The weight fluctuation is totally normal and happens to lots of people post diagnosis, your body wasn't able to use much of the carbs you were eating before, and now with insulin it will be, so don't be surprised if carbs have more of an impact on your weight now, it's just a part of life and honestly you'd rather gain a little weight than go into dka. It's stressful trying to get a handle on this disease, but the first few months are the hardest, everything's still a bit out of whack, be patient with yourself while your body tries to find equilibrium.

What helped me was not looking back. I went forward instead. I was diagnosed in late spring and played on the baseball team right away that summer. It didn't go that well so I took the fall semester off from sports, so I could get more used to T1. In spring I was back on the golf team, and played football again in the fall when I was 17. I was also in the music program and I ended up with a small part in the school play that year. The point of all that is, you can do most of the things your peers are doing.

I want to assure you that this weight gain is a normal process and will balance out once your body stabilizes. When you don't have enough insulin, your body utilizes fat to power the body and produces a  byproduct called ketones which enter your body, you then end up peeing this out as it's not good to have in your system. However, now that you're taking insulin, your body no longer needs to rely on fat stores for fuel. As a result, you're currently regaining body fat because your body is using the appropriate hormone, insulin, to fuel itself and so your body is no longer burning through your fat stores.

Pump died - Tandem stepped up,"Pump woke me up Sunday morning at 3am with a ""Cartridge Error"". I tried to reload a new cartridge, but it was stubborn and kept giving the same error. After several attempts, it finally accepted the changed cartridge. Went back to sleep.

Went through the same sequence at 6am, 11am and 3pm. I searched all the possible fixes online and hoped for the best with each attempt. I had been on hold with Tandem at 3am, but once it accepted the cartridge, I deemed sleep more important than pursuing an on-hold call.

I called Tandem at 3:25pm on Sunday. The rep talked me through the possible fixes and took down some info (lot#, error codes, blood sugar reading, etc.). We agreed that it seemed the pump needed to be replaced. She asked me if I was comfortable with alternative methods of insulin delivery until the pump arrived. I've had T1D since 1975, so going old school was no biggie.

I liked my ‚Äúpre diagnosis‚Äù body.,"I was diagnosed this year (30f), and I know in a lot of cases, people about to be diagnosed lose an extreme amount of weight very rapidly. For me, I had adopted a dog a few months before I think my pancreas started to crap out, so we were walking and hiking 3-5 miles, five days a week, and I was losing weight over the course of about a year and gaining muscle and really happy with my body. I thought I was just doing a great job getting in better shape. I will admit the muscle gain stopped probably about 6-7 months before my diagnosis but I also stopped losing weight as rapidly and just figured I was leveling out, and it wasn‚Äôt ever more than walks/hikes so I didn‚Äôt expect to gain ‚Äúweightlifting‚Äù muscles or anything like that. But my legs were trim and toned, my waist was shrinking. And to top it all off, I felt great most of the time. 

I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one who has felt this way but I really liked myself when I was 130 and toned. Now creeping back up toward 160, currently between 150-55, which isn‚Äôt ‚Äúunhealthy‚Äù for my height and I still have just as much muscle mass - and have regained a lot of strength since being on insulin! - but I feel like I miss the body that I had before I knew I was ill. I guess I was finally happy with my body, and I was the same size and weight as I was when I graduated from high school. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the skinny sized jeans still fit and I‚Äôm still taking the dog (and his doggie friends sometimes) on long walks and hikes a few times a week as I recover from DKA and the Covid I got a few weeks after the DKA in March/April of this year. But I can‚Äôt help but look at myself in the mirror and be upset that the weight came back so quickly in just four months of actually being able to absorb my food properly.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14vzrz3/i_liked_my_pre_diagnosis_body/,"['Honestly?

I never had an unhealthy relationship with food but I've limited my carb consumption since diagnosis. Four months later and I'm still 130lb. The funny thing is I actually eat more now and have scheduled meals. Prior to diagnosis I'd skip breakfast as well as lunch with high carb snacks sprinkled in here and there. I think the trick is to just eat fewer carbs and limit snacking. I also don't adjust my fast acting dosage for the food I'm eating. I adjust the food quantity to a fixed insulin dosage. If I miscalculate the quantity and go slightly low, I'll use it as an excuse to snack (pistachios, walnuts, small fruit) without bolusing. If I'm slightly high I'll do a few lunges across my room.

Low symptoms even if I'm far from an actual low?,"Hi there,

I have uncontrolled diabetes for a few years now, it's especially on the higher side most of the time (200-250mg/dl).

If I ignore these symptoms, knowing that I'm far from an actual hypo, would that actually be bad for me? Because my body is not used to it.

I'm Giving Up (carbs in the morning),"I have breakfast at around 07:30. On average, my insulin ratio is double for breakfast than any other meal in the day, but is most unpredictable also. I often have to correct with more insulin/carbs, whereas my lunch/dinner boluses are usually spot on.

So I've come to terms with the fact that carbs are just unsuitable in the AM. Everything is much smoother with a high fat/protein meal instead (avocado + eggs scrambled in butter is my go to).

Diabetic Rage?,"Hello! My partner is a 30-year-old man who was diagnosed with type one diabetes about a year ago. His honeymoon phase is quickly coming to an end. As a result, his blood glucose is all over the place. Tonight, he‚Äôs exhibiting some aggressive behavior, and I don‚Äôt know if I should be concerned. 

He did a few odd things around the house before coming to bed (e.g., hurrying to another room and playing a cymbal). He has a history of sleepwalking, so I laughed and asked what was going on. He then proceeded to get really upset with me. He started to act like I was out of line to ask about the cymbal then shushed me.

This is super unlike him. We rarely argue, and he‚Äôs certainly never went in on me for no reason like he just did. 

I feel like this might be related to his blood sugar. He‚Äôs not wearing his CGM, so I want to ask him to get up and check. But I don‚Äôt want to unnecessarily bother him. Is diabetic rage a real thing?

*Update: I left his regular glucose monitor on his nightstand with a note to check his glucose and ketones. He checked this morning while I was sleeping, and it was quite high. I talked to him about the outburst. He has absolutely no recollection of it and said he isn‚Äôt sure what happened. We‚Äôre thinking it was related to his glucose.

Tandem/CGM,"Hello,

I turned the alarm off but the problem is when I‚Äôm trying to sleep I‚Äôm afraid to have the control IQ not working and afraid to turn the alarms off (during the day I‚Äôll silence them but at night I‚Äôm hesitant to do that). 

I know it helps if I wear them on the same side (someone told me that and it‚Äôs good advice) and I try to do that, but sometimes it happens even on the same side. Doesn‚Äôt last forever.

Irregular blood sugar levels,"For a few days now my blood sugar levels have been all over the place, with boluses not doing what I'm expecting.  

Short recap of the situation this morning:  I use Tresiba (24 units) for long acting insulin and Novorapid  (12U per standard meal) for short acting insulin.  All of yesterday afternoon, I have been low even after pounding sugary drinks to the point of feeling sick.  This is in the afternoon after having my midday meal where I've put my usual amount of 12U Novorapid.  Even after eating 3 sandwiches spread over the course of the afternoon, without administering any extra insulin, my sugar levels stay on the lower side but not critically low.

Then, all of a sudden in the evening, they spike to 23mmol/L.  This is around 10pm.  At around 11:30 I put a bolus to correct, after which it dips down to 12mmol/L (so still a bit too high) at 3am, after which it spikes back up to 23mmol/L at 6am.  Without me having consumed any carbs at all during the night.  In the morning at 7:30am, I correct with a full 12U.  At 9 am, nothing has changed yet which is absolutely strange considering the amounts I administered before, so I correct yet again with another 6U (the normal bolus for those levels).  

At 10 am, I have two pieces of bread and a banana for which I account with 6U; almost half my normal amount for this time considering the amount of insulin I've administered this morning.  By 11am I enter normal ranges.  A bit after noon it starts going low again.  I have a sugary drink, right after this it's also my lunch time.  

I have 4 pieces of bread with cheese and yet again 2 more sugary drinks with that because I still keep feeling uneasy and low throughout my lunchbreak.  I once again only put 7U this time considering the amount of insulin previously admininistered, where I would normally have put 12U+.  Right after having finished my lunch I start getting alarms for low glucose again so I have another sugary drink.  I still feel awful 5 minutes after so I make some tea and put in about 35 grams of sugar.  I have that with a bunch of blueberries and a banana and right now we are about an hour later.  At this point my sugar is still quite low (4mmol/L; so just above the treshold).  

&#x200B;

What the hell is going on?  In my mind there could be two explanations:

1.  My rapid acting insulin is somehow taking way longer to kick in
2. My long acting insulin is somehow way more potent than usual and is causing irregularities

If anyone could weigh in on how I can fix this that would be great because this has been going on for three days now and I would like to know what's going on.  In any case I will be switching insulin pens for tonight to see if that makes any difference at all for tomorrow.

My boyfriend was just diagnosed with T1D,"It‚Äôs been three days since he told me about his situation. Last week his test result went 200(?) and then re-test again and it was 180(?).

He gets like (118-95) now that he‚Äôs taking pills. But he feels really weak and tired and very sleepy. He will visit the doctor again next week and get an MRI.

I am very worried and i keep crying about it. We are in a long distance relationship and I could only support from a far. I love him so much and I don‚Äôt know what to do.

But please be aware that insulin pills don\'t exist. However, inhaled insulin DOES exist and is a game changer.', 'That doesn\'t sound too unusual (except for the insulin pills bit). While a lot of people diagnosed with T1D are diagnosed in hospital after being admitted for DKA (Diabetic Keto-Acidosis - a condition that occurs when the body breaks down protein and fat in the body as an energy source becasue it cannot use carbohydrates due to a lack of insulin - the process creates chemical species known as ketones and also causes the blood to become more acidic, which is dangerous and damaging to many organs), there are also many who are diagnosed well before they get to that stage and the initial treatment can vary widely.\n\nIn people diagnosed after childhood, it is not uncommon for the depleting on insulin-producing beta cells to occur at a much slower rate so that the onset of T1D and its symptoms are much more gradual. If 180/200 was your boyfirend\'s diagnosis level, then it sounds like he falls into this category. When the onset is gradual, tablets that increase insulin production and/or increase insulin sensitivity can be quite effective for a while and can be useful to gradually educate a newly diagnosed person with diabetes about diabetes, insulin treatment, etc. without having to throw them in at the deep end. For people who are diagnosed with very high blood sugar and DKA, they usually need to go straight onto insulin. It sounds like the pills are working for your boyfriend at the moment and that gives him some breathing space - but it is only temporary: ultimately T1D needs to be treated with insulin.\n\nIn my case, I was 23 when I noticed that I was constantly thirsty and was needing to go to the toilet to pee around about every hour. I had only noticed this happening for a few days and had no symptoms of DKA. I was aware that thirst and frequent urination were symptoms of diabetes becasue I had an uncle with T1D and also had a friend at uni with T1D, so I went to my doctor and shared my concerns. They tested by blood sugar and it was high (I don\'t remember what it was, this was 32 years ago) so they got me in to see an endocrinologist that same day or the next. Presumably, based on my blood glucose not being super high (probably similar to your boyfriend\'s), the endo diagnosed me as likely having T2D (I was unaware of T2 diabetes, having only encountered people with T1D) and putting me on one variety of pills. I know that he also thenhad a c-peptide test but it wasn\'t low enough for  a T1 diagosis. The pills worked pretty well for a few months but they started to become less effective and I was switched to another type of pill (Metformin), which got things under control for another few months, until it didn\'t.\n\nI can\'t remember whether my c-peptide dropped significantly or if the pattern of the pills no longer working after a time was enough for the endo to change his diagnosis but aboout 6-9 months after being diagnosed with T2D, the endo said that I had T1D and started me on insulin. I have been using insulin for about 31 years now.\n\nThere is a lot for your boyfiend to take in at the moment: he needs to understand what diabetes is and what it does to your body (both in terms of the direct effects on insulin production but also the secondary effects, like hypo- and hyper-glycaemia and long-term ""complications), he needs to learn how our bodies respond to diferent types of food, particularly carbohydrates, and to insulin and other factors that affect blood sugars (exercise, stress, illness, etc.), he needs to put all of this tegether and learn how to keep his blood sugar within a fairly narrow window through monitoring and acting, instead of it being done automatically by his body.All of this can, and usually does, take a huge mental toll adn mental health issues are higher in people with diabetes because of this extra, constant mental burden.\n\nHowever, T1D *IS* manageable and, in my experience, it gets easier with time and as you learn more about the disease and how insulin therapy works, especially if you really dig into the details. If he is able to access modern technology, like pumps and continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and particularly if he can combine these with a looping setup (this is where a program running on a pump or a device, like a phone, monitors blood sugar via the CGM and controls the flow of insulin into the body via the pump to try to keep his blood sugar in the desired range) then a big chunk of the mental burden and effort disappears and, depending on the system he uses and his own individual variety of diabetes, he can almost live like someone without diabetes (he will always need to be conscious of and manage some things, like what he eats, when/how he exercises, taking into account the delay in CGM readings or in insulin activity profiles but these do become second nature). While there are some things that are more difficult to do, or be allowed to do, with diabetes, I can\'t think of a single thing that I would have done in my life that I didn\'t because of diabetes. I\'ve earned 2 degrees (one post-diagnosis), had several rewarding careers, travelled, married, had 2 wonderful children and I\'m now planning my retirement in a few years\' time, with lots of international travel pencilled in. Diabetes is not going to stop me living a lot more years yet and enjoying them.', '(I am not a doctor, and would always suggest a medical professional for any medical questions) I was diagnosed at 13 with a sugar of 412 so my experiences and care for it may be different. From what I remember, getting tiered is very very normal now that his blood sugars are down a bit. His body has been going into starvation mode as it is not getting the nutrients its needed, so once it gets insulin again it wants to recover. He may also eat quite a bit more food for a bit, my apatite was way bigger for a bit after I was diagnosed, that\'s just your body regaining what it lost. All that said I would ask his endocrinologist about those questions. \n\nMore than anything, make sure to do research, on the struggles. There is SO much misunderstanding. Give him support but understand that he is the diabetic, and he will be trained on this and understand it. After a long time it can get very annoying to constantly hear ""what\'s your blood sugar"" if I say I\'m sick, because I very well understand that\'s the first thing to check when you feel bad. Those reminders can be helpful at the beginning but just remember not to try to take care of his diabetes for him. That doesn\'t meant you cant ask him what you can do for him, ofc, and ask him as time goes on, he may realize the different struggles as he cares for himself every day and 6 months down the line, certain things might be more difficult then others.\n\nMost people adjust pretty well, but it can be an extreme struggle if you\'re also having depression or other life stressors.

Travelling with diabetes,"Hi all!

Question for you guys, (I‚Äôm not diabetic, but my mom is) so I like to always be prepared and educated just in case anything happens, I have knowledge. I‚Äôve purchased some plane tickets for my mom, and surprising her with them soon. However she takes insulin pens.

The problem is this: If your glucose is high and you don\'t have enough insulin in your body to use the glucose, your cells will continue to signal they need glucose for fuel, and your liver will continue to put out that glucose. Without insulin to let the glucose into the cells, the glucose keeps building up in your blood, pushing your blood glucose levels higher and higher.  \nIf you have enough insulin available, exercise may actually help lower your glucose. In fact, many athletes raise their blood glucose before exercise on purpose to create a bit of a buffer so they won\'t go low during their activity."" - from a random ass [site](https://www.sharecare.com/health/living-with-diabetes/safe-exercise-if-blood-glucose-level-is-high), not siting the source, but I know this to be true from other literature I\'ve read and can\'t seem to find right now....\n\nIt\'s a really tricky balance, and each person\'s miles will vary depending on their individual body chemistry. \n\nMore on insulin\'s involvement in muscle building [here](https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/the-muscle-building-messenger-complete-guide-to-insulin.html).\n\nI absolutely cannot exercise with IOB - I TANK.

The scenario given above ""If your blood glucose is higher than 300 mg/dl, you should not exercise until you have taken some fast-acting insulin and your blood glucose level is below 250 mg/dl."" would not work for me - I\'d need to wait until the insulin has worn off & I\'m solidly in range.']"

Psychedelics related question,"38m in Southern California diagnosed at 23. Tandem and Dexcom combo.

Going on a road trip up to Crater Lake, Oregon for a week and am planning on dropping acid for the first time in the woods with my friends.  I am a pretty regular psilocybin user but don't really go heroes journey too often.  Once every few years or so I go far out.

What would be an appropriate dose (blotter tabs) if I want to be present enough to respond to my alarms.  My rates are pretty dialed in so I'm not worried about dying or anything...just don't want to ruin a good trip with shitty glucose levels.

Any general advice regarding diabetic preparation for a psychedelic trip is also appreciated.

Tandem/Dexcom: What DON'T you like?,"I've posted a couple times about my Medtronic pumps cracking and... well. My latest ~2 month old replacement has cracked! (This is my shocked face...)

I'm really considering switching to Tandem/Dexcom because I'm tired of dealing with low quality pumps that fall apart! Additionally, seeing others talk here and after taking with my endo, I think Tandem and Dexcom sound like a better quality devices. 

If/when I talk to a Tandem rep, I'm going to get all the details about why their pump and sensors are great. So I would like to hear from users about things you DON'T like. Not because I want to be talked out of changing, but because I want to go into this with realistic expectations and know what I'm dealing with. 

I also was wondering about whether charging the pump is pain? In theory I'm all for rechargeable batteries, but the idea of being tied to an outlet is... unappealing. At least with my Medtronic pump, I know I'm never far away from somewhere I can buy a AA battery or someone who can give me one. How do you deal with charging?

Note: I am aware of insurance not covering a new pump while my current one is in warranty and I know Tandem has a program to get around it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14uwhtf/tandemdexcom_what_dont_you_like/,"['I have very, very few negatives about the Tslim/Dexcom combo, but the ones I do have are sort of nitpicky. \n\n1.

I wish someone would make a spring clip I can use to put it on my pocket, like we did with pagers back in the days before cell phones. I ended up with an $8 clip from Amazon slapped to the back of my pump, which works best for me. \n\n2. There‚Äôs no brightness setting. It‚Äôs perfectly fine during the day, but when I wake up in the middle of the night and check it, I‚Äôd rather have an option to not burn my retinas out. \n\n3. Charging. I personally find it annoying. I plug it in during a meeting at work or while I‚Äôm showering or while I‚Äôm on the couch watching TV, but I think I‚Äôd rather be able to replace a battery. That being said, I‚Äôm also reasonably sure if I had to replace the battery, I‚Äôd be complaining about the cost of batteries‚Ä¶so I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a good way to go about this. What I like about the Omnipod 5 is I can charge it overnight like my phone, but the tubing on the Tslim sort of makes that a really bad idea. \n\nOne thing I want to add (and it‚Äôs a pro‚Ä¶sorry I can‚Äôt follow directions) that your Tandem rep probably won‚Äôt say is that Tandem customer service is UNBELIEVABLE. Every time I‚Äôve called, it‚Äôs been a great experience‚Ä¶and this is from someone who DESPISES having to make phone calls. \n\nThey‚Äôve replaced infusion sets for anything and everything. They‚Äôve replaced cartridges. They will overnight a replacement pump, should yours break. I once had insulin go bad, and I ran through a bunch of supplies before I figured it out. I called Tandem, SURE they wouldn‚Äôt replace three full site changes, and the first thing the rep asked was ‚Äúare you ok?‚Äù \n\nI was panicked because I had literally wasted 9 days worth of sites, and I was rambling about that and crying, and she said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll replace whatever you wasted. Are YOU ok, though?‚Äù  I calmed down and assured her I was because I had used a syringe and injected from a fresh batch. Then she put in a replacement order for supplies, which showed up later that week. \n\nThat experience made me feel like *I*, as a person, was important to Tandem, not just my money. They stand behind their products, and the people that staff those lines are either T1s themselves or related to a T1 (from what I‚Äôve experienced). That level of support is so uncommon these days.', ""My only real negative is the number of alerts and alarms, many of which are repetitive and unnecessary with no options to disable them. For example, low insulin alert goes off 3 or 4 times. Once would be sufficient. Sensor expiring goes off many times. Again once would be sufficient. Out of insulin goes off every five minutes until you replace the cartridge. It sometimes happens you aren't able to replace it right away. Well 20 or 30 minutes without insulin isn't going to kill me but the alarms make we want to take a hammer to it. There's many more. Some people will disagree and say you can turn off many of the alarms. That is true but there are still many alerts and alarms that you can't.  \n\nI have turned off all the ones that can be turned off and it still seems like I'm having to deal with annoying alarms every day.\n\nSo if you like alarm fatigue, Tandem is the pump for you.

Dexcom has a much more civilized way of inserting the sensor. \n\nHope this helps but I would not hesitate to switch. \n\nI‚Äôm almost a year in with the Tandem/Dexcom pair and am typically >75% TIR. Today, for example, I‚Äôm at 88%. My a1c has also dropped a half point.', 'Around 4-5 o‚Äôclock every day my sugar gets low enough for me to snack, I snack and it climbs to about 140 then my pump gives me a full unit correction, then I‚Äôm battling another low in about half an hour. It‚Äôs this way until I can eat dinner. \n\nI know I can probably adjust it (my routine and the correction) but it just catches me\nOff guard once in a while. \n\nAlso I have struggled with the inserter unit thing. I feel like I‚Äôm bad at doing that part but can‚Äôt seem to improve it.', 'Diabetes sucks. Tslimx2+dexy isn‚Äôt perfect, but it‚Äôs damn near magical and I‚Äôm never ever ever giving it back. People talk about taking pump breaks, I will never lol', 'What I don‚Äôt like about Dexcom is that every new sensor reads high after warmup.  I‚Äôm not talking something like my meter is 85, Dexcom is 110.  More like meter is 85 and Dexcom is 195.  This means Control IQ is useless until I can calibrate Dexcom to where it needs to be.  You‚Äôve heard Dexcom doesn‚Äôt require calibrations?  That‚Äôs a lie, but at least it doesn‚Äôt force them on you twice a day (btw the new Guardian 4 sensors won‚Äôt either).  I also find Dexcom is far more prone to compression lows than Medtronic, and loses connection to the pump/phone more often than Medtronic.  Otherwise Dexcom works fine and the insertion is a breeze.\n\nControl IQ is miles above auto mode on the 670/770 but  I have no comparison to the 780 yet, although I plan on trying that out.  CIQ isn‚Äôt perfect and you will have to do a lot of tweaking of your settings to get it to work as it should.  Your Medtronic settings will have to be changed, if you just put them into the Tandem pump you will probably be out of range.  Sleep mode aims for a lower target but will not do automatic corrections.  I prefer sleep mode and will correct myself as needed.\n\nIf you are currently using the Sure-T or Silhouette with Medtronic you‚Äôll be happy with the similar sets from Tandem.  If you are using the Mio Advanced (or the 7 day set) or QuickSet you might not be happy.  The 90 degree soft cannula sets that Tandem has are both like the original Mio, in that big round disposable inserter.  The difference between the Autosoft 90 & XC is where it connects to the set.  The 90 is exactly like the old Mio while the XC is much easier to connect/disconnect.  I hate these sets but the steel needle hurts me so much and the angled sets can only be used in my abdomen, and I wore that out after 16 years of exclusively putting Silhouettes there.  I really miss the Mio Advanced.  The bulky connector on the tubing can be a pain in the ass when I‚Äôm trying to get the pump out of the small pocket on some pants I have but it usually isn‚Äôt a big deal.\n\nFilling a cartridge is more time consuming than a Medtronic reservoir.  Because of the way it works (a plastic bag inside the plastic housing) the pump can never know exactly how much insulin is in there.  I fill it with 300 units, it shows 180+ and then eventually 220+, maybe more.  When it gets to zero all delivery will stop even though there‚Äôs another 20-25 units left in there.  Because of that bulky tubing connector, filling the tubing requires more insulin that Medtronic.  Overall there is a good amount of insulin waste.\n\nSomeone else mentioned the case. It does suck.  I bought a Type 1 Tactical case but it is so bulky (I‚Äôm a woman, I can‚Äôt wear the pump on my waist) I gave up.  I just put the pump in my pocket and use a case at night only to clip it to my panties to sleep. \n\nOverall I am much happier with the Tandem/Dexcom system than the 670/770.  I switched for the algorithm, the Guardian sensors worked great for me and better in some ways than Dexcom.  I am eligible for the 780 software upgrade and have submitted everything for that and I‚Äôm interested in comparing the two.', 'I love my Tandem, but there‚Äôs one thing I don‚Äôt like that bothers me: I cannot use Fiasp with it.

However, the modals look identical, and it is easy to accidentally give yourself 10 units instead of correcting for 10g carbs which for me is about .3 units. \n\nLike others have mentioned, changing the set is a little more involved, charging is something people have preferences on, and it‚Äôs reliant on your current settings (vs Medtronic).

The number is just being subtracted at the front end.  And it doesn't matter if the pump says 0 units in the reservoir, the design of it **does not allow it to be completely emptied.**  This is common knowledge and is due to the design of the system, which uses a plastic bag, instead of a rigid syringe like reservoir.

insulin pump,i feel like having an insulin pump would just be better but my endocrinologist said that she‚Äôd start me on a pump once i stop producing insulin but i‚Äôm getting bored of injecting myself could i start the pump sooner by suggesting it to my dr,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14v4zow/insulin_pump/,"[""The reason your endo is encouraging you to wait is because insulin pumps take significant programming. When you're still in the honeymoon stage it is very easy for a pump to give you too much insulin. \n\nIn theory you could start on one but managing it would likely take more time and effort than injecting."", 'I love the idea of a pump in honeymoon. You can dose much more precisely. So, if your insulin needs are low, you can meet them much more safely with a pump. \n\nAnd, since pumps use rapid insulin for basal, you can handle variable inputs from your own pancreas more safely. If you turn out to need a lot less today, you‚Äôre not relying on yesterday‚Äôs injected basal insulin.', 'I would push back a bit on that.  A pump might be easier to work with because you can create multiple basal routines, making it easier for you to adapt as your body changes and your insulin production diminishes.  During this time, your body‚Äôs insulin production may be unstable.  It‚Äôs generally not a linear fall off, so having some flexibility will be an advantage, IMHO.  Also, this period is indeterminate; you have no idea how long it may last.  \n\nIn the meantime, while you are having this discussion with your doctor, there‚Äôs much for you to learn about the types of pumps, and  how they work, along with concepts like Insulin:Carb ratio and Insulin Correction factor.  While none of this is particularly hard to grasp, they are really crucial for managing the pump correcly.  \n\nThe better prepared you are, the better case you‚Äôll have.', 'Oh no no no no no‚Ä¶.you don‚Äôt want a pump until your body has settled in to wherever it will. \n\nThe problem is, during your honeymoon, your beta cells are in the process of dying off. So, sometimes they‚Äôll randomly kick out insulin; sometimes they won‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a pain, but you want to stay on injections until you stabilize, THEN go to a pump. \n\nYou‚Äôll also need to be familiar with your injection routine in case you do something foolish like break your pump at 2am stumbling around in the bathroom. Ask me how I know.', 'I don‚Äôt think being bored is a reason to go on a pump, sorry kiddo.', ""I am a year since DX I am still honeymooning. I was given a pump 2 months into it.

I rarely have lows unless I over calculate my carbs. And my highs are 180 at most. \n\nAs long as you take the time to understand how it all works and learn how to adjust things a pump is perfectly fine. I eat what I want to. It's a matter if learning how to manage the disease and learning how your body reacts and how to adjust.\n\nPush back get the training, get a good dietitian who is a diabetic specialist, read these forums, and use common sense and take care of yourself."", ""I agree with some of the others, I think a pump would be easier than MDI while someone is honeymooning.

But after being T1 for 37 years, the first \\~22 on MDI and the last \\~15 on a pump, I have no intentions to ever go back to MDI.  I'd give up my CGM, first."", ""That is what your blood sugar testing and labs are for, if your blood is going high you would correct with insulin, would you not? \n\nYou'd be better off w/a CGM rather than a pump until your body stops producing.

You can adjust to changes much easier and more quickly"", 'omg noo your scaring me with this honeymoon phase but how would i know exactly when they all died off would i go into another dka', 'Do they need to know how to manage with shots?

Walgreens Issues?,"Hi there. My wife is having trouble getting her Levemir pens and Dexcom 7 sensors with Walgreens. They keep only giving her part of the prescription order even though it shows she picked up the whole order.

Race biking,"I just started this new hobby. Cycling avg. 30km/h, currently 40-50kms. Two questions:

When going for an early morning ride, I have to disable my pump to not go low. How do you manage for the basal already on board (due to the regular program)? Or would this require activating a different basal program if you know you‚Äôll be cycling the next morning?

Before heading out, I can eat everything. Let‚Äôs say I start with 30g carbs without bolusing. Then after 15kms (30-45mins) I start dropping heavily. Like downing a liter of sugar water and taking gels not to go low, even while my pump is fully disabled. I could risk not downing it, and due to no IOB my body might catch the low itself, but when on 5 with double arrows down, this doesn‚Äôt feel nice. How could I better deal with this?

Here to learn. What recommendations would you have for these situations? Thx!",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14v7dro/race_biking/,"[""When I go for workouts, I generally reduce my basal about 30-45 minutes before I start planning to exercise.

The number 2 consern is to inject enough insulin to transfer that energy into my muscles, and the number 3 concern is to make that happen in a way that keeps my blood sugar in a reasonable range.   \n\nIf I started by trying to be in range rather than by making sure I get enough carbs to function properly my performance would drop significantly.""]"
Blood sugar - post meal plateau then sudden rise.,"In this example at the blue mark I injected 6 units of fast acting novorapid just before eating two sandwiches (4 slices of wholemeal). The post meal level rose, steadied and then ""bang!"" shot up with my dexcom alerting me that I'd gone above my set high level goal. 

The second example is wavey through the afternoon, post meal high on left dropping, short plateau, rising then falling then rising despite no carbs taken during this period.

I'm not looking for advice really rather it's the science of what's happening I'm wondering about. The rise, plateau and then second more dramatic rise phenomena.

Male Fertility and T1D,"Hello all - my wife and I are trying to get pregnant, and it seems that there is research out there suggesting the correlation between T1D and male infertility to be higher than male infertility in the general population.

In my personal experience, the few days after a trip can feel a lot like serotonin syndrome (ie too much serotonin in your brain, which can cause weird nausea but nothing too serious in my case) but again personal experience not medical advice. If I were you and wanted to experience what the mushrooms are like by themselves, I'd take maybe three days break from other substances in advance. If the SSRIs affect your stomach at all, look out for added nausea, as the mushrooms are a nausea inducing substance for most. Lots of drugs also impact how much the temperature outside affects you, so if you plan on tripping outside (tripping makes some people feel claustrophobic) be mindful of heat stroke and dehydration. Others are saying bring a snack In case of lows, I'd highly recommend some kind of fruit, you feel kind of spacey and or nauseous while tripping and it's easier to think of yourself as a primate snacking on blackberries than something processed like chips, texture of food can play a big role in trying to eat while tripping.

This is particularly true of the cone cells that are predominant in the fovea (central part of the retina), which are among the most energy-intensive cells in the body and are very sensitive to availability of glucose. It seems likely that decreased blood sugar during hypoglycaemia results in dysfunction of the cone cells, which is what causes the scotoma (visual disturbances) that you've noticed.\n\nEdit: To be clear, as far as I'm aware there's nothing to worry about beyond the general concerns associated with severe hypoglycaemia.

How often do you meet other people who are T1 diabetic?,"My boyfriend is T1 and he's relatively open about it - uses Novalog in public, told me about it on our first date, etc. The other day, we met up with my brother and his friends, and my bf noticed that one of the friends had a cgm.

Later on, I asked my bf if he's met a lot of diabetics and to my surprise he said he has never had a conversation with another T1 in person before!!! He's been diagnosed for around 10 years.

What to use to cover infusion site to avoid getting it dirty?,"Going to start landscaping job on Monday, but have my pump training date on Tuesday.

"Insulin copays, deductibles, and high deductible insurance PSA","First, let me state that I am NOT complaining about the cap on insulin cost.  I am just giving info to people in my situation. **This will not affect the majority of people** I think - if you usually pay copays it probably won't be a change for you.   

I have a ""high-deductible"" insurance plan. Usually each year between my insulin, meds, and pump supplies I hit both my deductible and out-of-pocket max (which are roughly the same amount) by April and then I pay nothing else for the rest of the year.  I don't have copays etc.  I just pay for everything till I reach that out-of-pocket max.  

This year without realizing the cap on insulin I was surprised when my first 3 month supply of insulin was so low ($75), but it was nice. Here is the thing - my insurance now calls that a copay and the copay doesn't go towards the deductible, though it did go towards my out-of-pocket max.  

I'm just wanting to let others know that it may have changed on you as well and if you have the same situation you may not hit the deductible as early as you were thinking you would.  You should check with your plan if you are in a similar situation.  It may not change your situation overall, but if your max is quite a bit higher than your deductible it might.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14tn03s/insulin_copays_deductibles_and_high_deductible/,['Pm me we gottttttta talk']

Since this change I've had a problem every single time filling my prescription with delays on stock on all the surrounding pharmacies. I'm located in Illinois. Does anyone else have this issue? Im considering talking to my doctor about switching my insulin because of how stressful this is. It took me about 3 weeks last time to get my insulin supply and I had to drive an hour to get it. I just don't understand why it was so easy for me to go to my local Walmart and buy cheap insulin without it ever being an issue and now I'm struggling to keep a steady supply.,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14t7jyd/anyone_else_have_terrible_time_getting_insulin/,"['Get them to change to humalog or novolog.

Pumps,Hello so currently I‚Äôm on vacation and been doing a very crappy job of calculating my meals or taking enough insulin. So I have been having a lot of highs and I‚Äôve also grown tired of constantly having to give myself insulin with the pens so I have been thinking about getting a pump when I go back home. So I was hoping I could get some good recommendations and more about what the pump is like and how the normally work. Any help would be amazing.,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14th8dj/pumps/,"[""I use the Tandem t:slim X2, Dexcom G6, with iPhone/AppleWatch. Whether you create your own  basal profiles (up to 6 profiles) or choose Basal IQ or Control IQ, this combo is the closest thing to a cure until there is one. To put this in context of travel stress and facing richer foods, you can manually raise the basal (to blunt the blood glucose rise) and lower at will. If you figure out your basal rate for sleep (equilibrium amount of insulin to keep blood glucose steady without food), you can select it and sleep undisturbed through the night. Loops can do this too but don't do so well with food extremes or if you're physically active because an algorithm cannot know what you're doing next. Algorithm relies on interstitial fluid (not blood) readings that lag behind real blood glucose by up to 15-20 minutes i.e., reactive insulin adjustment instead of proactive insulin adjustment.\n\nWith Joy and Radiance, Live Long and Prosper"", 'I am recently on the Omnipod 5 but have used Dex cgm and Omnipods since their respective first generation devices.  I use the Dex g6 app on an iphone and also have an apple watch on which I can see my bg levels.  I have the Omnipod PDM as the second device.  Insulet corp have recently stated that the iPhone app will be available ‚Äòsoon‚Äô for the Omnipod 5 and that the Omnipod 5 will also pair with the Dexcom g7.  Hopefully by end of the year but no dates given.  If true this means that I‚Äôll only need the phone app and watch to manage both the CGM and pump. I have never used a different pump/cgm so have no opinions about them.  What I‚Äôm summarizing below, however, holds true for all of them.  Each pump will have it‚Äôs own pros and cons so worth investigating to see which one best suits you.\n\nA pump has many advantages over a pen/syringe.  First:\n\nConsistency of basal - there is no duration or peak to worry about.  On a pump, you set a basal rate, and it‚Äôs up to the pump to monitor and continue to drip out insulin at the pre-determined rate, for example, 1 unit an hour.\n\n2. Multiple basal rates - for example, you can set a unique basal rate for daytime vs night time.  Or have a different rate set for exercise.  Etc etc.\n\n3. Only need one type of insulin - pumps will use a short acting insulin for both basal and bolus.  Therefore there‚Äôs no need for you to carry both a long acting and short acting insulin.\n\n4. No needles to carry around and worry about.  No need to worry about how, when, or where to take a shot. And for travel, let‚Äôs face it, taking a shot on a plane or train or in a car is a terrible experience.\n\n5.  Potentially multiple ways of taking a bolus. For example, all at once, as you are used to, or, you can also extend out the dose, say, programming it to take 50 percent now, and then delaying the remaining 50 percent over some extended time period, say 2 hours.  This is useful for a restaurant or party setting where the length of meal is naturally longer than just eating at home.\n\n5a  ‚Äî note that you can better manage bolus calculations taking into account insulin sensitivity ratios and also insulin carb ratios.  It also factors in insulin on board when making bolus calcs.\n\n6. Travel - it‚Äôs much easier, imho, to travel with a pump, especially if you change time zones.  Again, because of the ability to adapt a basal program, and the fact that the basal is consistent.\n\n7. Exercise - it‚Äôs much easier to plan for exercise given the ability to create basal programs around it.\n\n8. So called closed - loop systems: systems where the pump reads from the cgm and automatically adjusts the basal rate according to some parameters.  (see 5a) They also use this information to calculate bolus.  Many come with a food library to help you calculate the amount of carbs for a meal.  NB even many non-closed loop systems come with a similar library which is a useful reference.\n\nAs you read more on the subject, you‚Äôll no doubt learn more.  Please remember that these are still tools for helping YOU manage your diabetes, and not answers in and of themselves.  Overall I find them incredibly useful and valuable and hope that I never have to go back to syringes and glucose meters.', 'A) talk with your endo about this and see what s/he recommends. B) I like the Medtronic pump/cgm match up.', 'I have the omnipod 5 and the dexcom g6.  Hopefully the iPhone integration will be coming soon.  I love it even having to carry an extra device.']"

Opinions on a Cure,"Hey everyone, hope y‚Äôall are doing well. Recently I got asked (by a person without diabetes) about my thoughts on a cure. Every once in a while someone asks me this as if it‚Äôs a novelty to them and I just restate the same opinion. Disclaimer: this is part rant but also part discussion. I get frustrated being asked the same question over and over so I‚Äôm curious what other T1Ds think.  Here we go:

In my 13+ years of having diabetes, I kept hearing how at some point in my lifetime a cure will be developed. I‚Äôm not sure if those claims were backed by science or just said to give a little kid some hope. But, I do think it‚Äôll happen one day. I don‚Äôt know when, but one day. Here and there I‚Äôll see very promising studies or trials published and it keeps that hope alive.

Here‚Äôs the catch: once that cure is developed, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be very accessible, if it all. I live in the US, and our healthcare system, in my opinion, is severely flawed. (This is not a jab against doctors/nurses/other medical professionals. They are very skilled people. I‚Äôm referring to how basic medications and treatments cost SO much money i.e. insulin.)

For those of you who live outside of the US, insulin is a very profitable business to be in for pharmaceutical and insurance companies. Think $5 USD of insulin is sold for $500 USD sort of thing.  In turn, people with diabetes are very profitable. We need insulin to live and there‚Äôs no cure, so we‚Äôll keep on buying it.

Low body fat % people: how do you take your insulin?,"Over the last 4-5 years, I've been steadily losing bodyfat and am out of good places to take my injections. Back in 2019, it escalated to the point of not being able to use my medtronic sure-t mini med sets because moving would literally cause the muscles to work the needle out and I'd have to constantly push it back in or start with a new site. For a while I found I could put it in the back of my arm and use a cell-phone arm pouch for my pump, but that stopped working around the end of 2020 and I've been using shots almost exclusively ever since.

The shots have been easier to a degree because I don't have to think about movement and whether or not my needle is still in/canula isn't crimped, but over the last 4-5 months, I've been having to either inject directly into muscle *(which are getting bruised and sore)* or into what I think is scar tissue *(due to over-injection. Pretty sure it's developing insulin resistance too).* It's to the point where it's extremely painful just to take 1 shot, not to mention the 5-7 in a day depending on how many shots I accidentally put in scar tissue that end up being useless and are allowing my glucose to spike.

For physical health context, I'm not athletic and I currently weigh about 130ibs at 5'6 and I'm 22 years old. I work a desk job and I only really get maybe 30 minutes of cycling in per week depending on whether or not I have the strength to get on the bike. The reasons I think I have such low fat are my avoidance of gluten *(not celiac, I don't think, but it makes me sick)*, high matabolism *(horay thyroid issues)*, and on top of that I'm about 95% positive I have undiagnosed ehlers danlos *(one of my symptoms being strechy tissue, which is why I thought I had body fat and not just scar tissue since I've always been able to pinch up)*.

I've tried putting on body fat by eating high fat foods like peanut butter, greek yogurt, and cheese, but they seem to do nothing. My NP was able to get me a coupon for the new inhaled insulin to avoid needles altogether for a while, but that was spiking my glucose low and then the coupon ran out and I can't afford it. Finally, I've had a lot of issues in the past with canula's crimping, and am trying to avoid that if possible.

When I asked my NP about other ways to manage shots, she basically just said that it's hard to say because aside from my health complications, I'm in great shape and they've never dealt with anyone who's had this kind of issue. That being said, she and her team are the best ones around so I don't really have anywhere else I know to go, but I've seen reddit work wonders for other people so I figured I'd try here.

Also, please no jokes, I've heard the ""you should drink beer"" a dozen times and I'm looking for actual help.

Any advice is extremely appreciated.

Question about Insulin,"Hello, my mom recently got melanoma and then diabetes type one, she is going to a polish wedding soon where new food is served every 1 hour for around 7 hours. She is wondering if she takes her insulin shot, then waits the 10-15 min and eats, how long can she keep eating. As in like are you only allowed one meal or could she eat another meal 30 minutes after. Thanks! Any help appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14tfrcv/question_about_insulin/,"[""There isn't a way to answer your question other than:\n\n1) Have her talk to her doctor to make a plan\n\n2) Give you general information that will help you do #1.\n\nIf you mom is T1, she may be on both long acting and short acting insulin, or be using an insulin pump which uses short acting to do what the long acting does along with the short acting.\n\nThe long acting is the background insulin, and shouldn't have much to do with meals.\n\nIt's the short acting I think you are asking about. Most short acting insulins work this way:\n\nYou estimate the carbs in the meal, your doctor works with you to have an insulin to carb ratio so that as those carbs (all carbs not just sugars) are metabolized into blood glucose, you have the right amount of insulin to cover those.\n\nThe challenge for T1s is that estimating carbs is not an exact thing, plus things like protein and especially fats can delay when the carbs get metabolized. Pizza and lasagna are famous for this. I imagine that a Polish wedding would have foods that are like pizza.\n\nThe other challenge is that most short acting insulins have an absorption of around 4 hours with the peak being 1 to 1 1/2 hours in.\n\nIf you are eating every hour, you'd be eating, dosing, and overlapping a lot of carbs and insulin.\n\nHave your mom talk to her endo/certified diabetes educator about ideas for this. Perhaps she eats every 2 hours, or checks more often. Stacking insulin doses can cause quite the puzzle and then possibly lows now, highs later (back to the fats delaying the carbs thing.)\n\nAnother issue is that if you mom is a new T1, she may still be making insulin, which may be helpful or make this harder to figure out.\n\nI would take your post and have your mom show her T1 med team and get some protocols for what to try to eat, dose, and check for the day of the wedding."", 'Speaking very generally it\'s the carbs that ""count"" with free sugars being the worst. Starches like rice also count but some are ""slow"" at breaking down and will affect her later than you would think. \n\nSo if she eats meats and veggies she could get away with quite a bit of eating without needing more insulin. But bread or sweets and she would not get far.\n\nHer best bet is to eat selectively from each course and monitor her blood sugar often. People will understand.\n\nDoes she have access to a [Continuous Glucose Monitor](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/managing-diabetes/continuous-glucose-monitoring). That would help a lot as they can give not just a reading but an up/down trend line which gives you a sort of speed of the rise or drop in sugar levels view.', ""Fast acting insulin lasts 3/4 hours. Eating continuously for 7 sounds like an absolute nightmare to carb count for. She'd be much better off with a pump for that. \n\nAlso depends a lot about what she will eat. Veggies? Sure, all day. Meat? Not exaggerated quantities but yeah, no issues. Same for fats. But if you start eating a ton of them, they'll break down in 4/5 hours too into glucose. Like, a slice of ham does nothing but an entire steak does stuff to be clear. \n\nGood luck dosing for that honestly... especially with alcohol, moderate quantities! Alcohol inhibits part of the liver, which doesn't release as much glucose as it should meaning you can go into hypos. But alcohol is also carbs, (especially fruity stuff) meaning it can also send you in hyper. Beer and red wine are preferable, cocktails are torture. \n\nIt's hard being a diabetic in everyday life but special events are even worse. Tell her to keep some coke or other sugar ready if she's going in hypo, hopefully she won't spike at 173949404... I can already imagine the rollercoaster of a graph that will be that day for the sensor."", ""This depends entirely on what insulin she's taking. Only way you can answer this is have her talk to her doctor.\n\nWith the insulin I'm on, I'd look at the food in front of me and do a rough carb count an inject for that. If another meal came out even 5 minutes later, I'd do the same thing.""]"
Any landscapers out there? Or tradesmen? Where do you keep your pump so it doesn‚Äôt break? Also should I get another case instead of the one that came with it?,"I‚Äôm going to be starting landscaping in a few days. I‚Äôm getting my pump training on Tuesday. Tandem tslim x2. 

The pump was necessary as I could never find the right basal rate for a 24 hour period. If I lowered it enough to not go low doing manual labour, I‚Äôd run high as soon as I finished. If I had it high enough to keep me in range outside of doing labour, I‚Äôd go low way too often. 

What‚Äôs the best place to keep a pump so it doesn‚Äôt break? I was going to keep it in my pocket, but my mother (who paid for the pump, bless her) thinks it‚Äôs best just staying on the belt clip. Very nervous about breaking this $7000 device. 

Also, should I get a new case? Is the one that comes with the tslim adequate, or are there better ones out there? I‚Äôve looked at quite a few but I can‚Äôt tell if they‚Äôd be better or not, hoping someone has some experience with tslim cases. 

During my work I‚Äôll be doing a lot of kneeling, getting up and down, and bending over. Also will be carrying lots of big rocks so I‚Äôm worried it being on the belt clip might get in the way. Mostly worried about it falling out/off and breaking, and a little bit worried about it getting crushed by a rock I‚Äôm carrying or something.

2 y/o is sick and can't raise his levels,"So my son was diagnosed in February and has been doing okay for the most part. We have stayed in range roughly 95% of the time. But last night he immediately got sluggish and threw up. We gave him anti nausea medicine and he went to bed. He did not wake up to throw up or anything. This morning he threw up again so we took him to the clinic and they tested him and told us he wasn't in DKA even though he was acting exactly like he did the first time he was diagnosed. 

Well on the car ride home, he threw up again so I dropped them off at home and went to get his prescription. While I was at the store, he went full hypoglycemic with blue lips, violent shaking and glazed eyes. I told my wife to make a sugary paste and rub it on his gums. She did and he bounced back but was still all kinds of messed up. He threw up multiple times after that and we couldn't get him to eat or drink and we knew he was dehydrated from all this so we went to the ER and got him on an IV before DKA could set in. 

Now we are back at home, he still can't get his blood sugar up, he's still throwing up and we are contemplating on taking him back to the ER since we can't get him to really eat. Even the on call doctor told us ""just give him more carbs"" as if she didn't hear us say that he was refusing any food or drinks.

Does anyone have a trick or a suggestion to get him to consume some sugar or a way to get him to absorb some carbs so he doesn't go hypoglycemic again? I've made another syrupy sugar water concoction and gave him 5ml of it, but it doesn't seem to raise his levels any.

Any experience random numbness above toes?,"So a week ago I noticed that the spot going between my second and third two is like 90% numb. It's not between my toes, it's on top where the toes originate. I think it has gotten slightly better but now sometimes when moving or walking, i get that tingly feeling you get when your arm is numb and it's actively wearing off (almost like static?) It doesn't hurt, I haven't injured myself and until a couple days ago, my sugars have been normal (this is due to needing my Iud replaced which I found out *today* fucking expired a year ago thanks to yet another dumb ass doctor who gave me the wrong IUD and info, so I had to get off pills that stop my nonstop bleeding because they were giving me severe migraines and I will probably start bleeding soon). I spike and immediately come down when eating or drinking so there isn't really any prolonged highs. Last I saw my A1C was 7%. It has been going down 1% every 3 months although I feel I'm at a standstill due to insulin resistance, a shitty lazy doctor and worthless american health insurance. I have an appointment with a new doctor who I got very lucky to be scheduled with as she had no availability until January but they immediately called me back to tell me she was available. I'm just curious as to others experience and what else it could be. The numbness has gotten better but it's still not 100% normal. My feet are also constantly twitching and recently my right butt cheek twitches all damn night. Some part of my body is always twitching and I've been like this since I was a child. They always say I'm not deficient in anything and my bloodwork and all that is normal but I think they're taking shortcuts and not checking everything. I just turned 26. This is the 4th doctor I'm seeing in 2 years (with no job, no money and driving over an hour for. Gotta love the state for f*cking me over as they owe me money through my job and wont pay me because of something that happened within the company before I was even hired. Funny how the health department is trying to kill me huh?) 
Drinking water or liquid IV doesn't help at all with the twitching. Neither do vitamins. Despite my shitty life, I wouldn't say I'm particularly stressed. I'm barely making it but if I really need money, my boyfriend will give me money for whatever I want, I just don't like taking money from people. I also don't have rent since I live with a friend who's about to retire and I take care of his mom and do house work.
I will probably ask the chiropractor if there's something he can do, as I have falling arches and no support and this may be a culprit. Getting adjusted a few years ago immediately fixed my pain and numbness in my arm. It's 300+ for stupid insoles and the store ones do absolutely nothing.

I can't figure out how the heck to translate whatever she said my correction factor into what the Inpen app is asking for. If anyone can translate this into a ratio or I guess whatever the app is asking for id appreciate it! Sorry if it's a dumb question and I'm just overlooking something that should be common sense.,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/14svr41,"['Looks like 1:6 is the unit:carb ratio, then the correction dosing is 2 units for every 50 mg/dl over 150.', 'I‚Äôm interpreting it as 2 units for every 50mg/dl you are over 150. so if you are 200 you‚Äôd take 2 units. But I‚Äôm not sure why they wouldn‚Äôt write it as 1/25>150, maybe a typo? If it is correct though i think the input in the app would be 25 mg/dl/U (each unit covers 25mg/dl). Does that ratio sound right to you based on your current regimen? Definitely get in touch with your doctor if you‚Äôre unsure', 'Yes that sounds about better in my opinion but I\'ll double check with my endo tomorrow. I had an annoying peek above 200 and decided to give the bolus calculator a try and it told me to give a half unit and me not thinking took it and my sugar was just like, ""lol tf you thought that was gonna do?"" And I realized my folly. I am used to mentally kinda reading the correction chart in my head for each sugar range so I never really thought about it in terms of fractions lol. I did eventually put the correct dose just from memory, (well I added the other 3.5 units necessary) thanks for your help.', '>""lol tf you thought that was gonna do?"" \n\nWow, your sugar talks just like my sugar!']"

The troubles of trying to avoid hyperglycemia at the gym,"Hey guys!

I would like to better understand how you guys manage your pre-workout blood glucose. 

When it's gym day, I apply a smaller amount of the rapid insulin at lunch and try, at the same time, to not leave my glycemia it super high. I work out at 3 pm, and I check my blood sugar at 2:30 pm - ideally, I can get it to 100-130 mg/dL. If it's in that range, I'll have a couple of tablespoons of sugar mixed with protein powder and powdered milk (...yeah). By doing this, after the gym the blood glucose is around 80-100 mg/dL. 

It's the only way I've found to not have hypoglycemia at the gym, but I'm a little worried about the potential hyperglycemia (I don't have a subcutaneous device) that I might have until I start working out...

More often than not, the outcome is mutually agreed and understood, based on giving me all of the facts.\n\nGetting a reliable CGM (Dexcom G6, in my case) was a hige step because it gave me so much more information to base my decisions on (the direction and rate of change of your blood sugar is just as useful as the actual number at any given time that you get from a meter, perhaps even more useful); then I started looping and a massive weight was lifted because I was able to (eventually) stop counting carbs (mostly) mot worry about bolusing and leave my loop to take care of just about everything on its own. I know that there are times when I need to be a bit more vigilant, like first thing in the morning, when I\'m less insulin sensitive or on day 3 of a pump site, when I\'m also not as responsive to insulin as on day 1 so I might need to intervene slightly in my loop\'s operation, depending on what I am eating - but overall I work a lot less and with more success to get better control than I ever did during those times when I did try to get better control in the past and I am almost never surprised by what my blood sugar does. Because I feel like I can actually control this thing, I am more vigilant becasue I see a point to it.\n\nThey say that people with T1 make around 180 extra health-related decisions every day - I feel like I have been able to reduce that to around 50 or less and the change in my mental load, mental exhaustion, depression and guilt is substantial. Honestly, I feel like I am seeing the sun for the first time after years of living under constantly cloudy skies. Obviously, this requires a good understanding of diabetes and some level of understanding of how the loop algorithm works (although I haven\'t really looked ""under the hood"" of the app) so that all of the rates, factors and ratios can be set correctly (and adjusted from time to time). I brought my HbA1c from constant 8s and 9s  to 6 in 5 months with this new approach and technology and I\'m getting better at it, and it is getting easier, every day. Education - knowledge and understanding - is the key to living a good life with this disease.', 'Honestly, I think mental care is just as important as insulin in a management routine.

Islet Act,"https://www.isletsforus.org/isletact

A dear friend of mine had diabetes and participated in a clinical study in which she received transplanted islet cells. Her doctor is Piotr Witkowski M.D. Ph.D at the University of Chicago Medical Center. While my friend will have to take anti-rejection meds (as with any organ transplant) she no longer has diabetes and it‚Äôs changed her life for the better. Great news, right? 

Except recently, the FDA apparently granted a license and exclusive rights to a for-profit company (CellTrans) for cadaveric islet distribution as a drug in the US. It happened despite multiple warnings from the transplant community and experts in the field about the serious negative effects of such a decision on patients and the entire field.

So, I‚Äôm writing here, on behalf of my friend who participated in the study and her life partner who, although he was not part of the study, is still living with diabetes. If you feel so inclined, please see the website above. Read the info, and if you feel comfortable, send a short email saying you support the Islet Act. 

If you are in the US and willing to forward the website to your local representatives, senators, etc. that would be amazing too. I would love for this to have bipartisan support.

"Diagnosed with T1 in October 2022, haven‚Äôt needed insulin yet - has anyone heard of this?","Hi! Apologies for any terminology issues - I am still learning. I have a relatively unique scenario, and I am hoping I can find someone like me as I navigate this. I (28 F) was diagnosed in October of 2022 with type 1. They actually found it on accident - I was being evaluated by a PCOS clinic at Mass General/Brigham, when they discovered that my A1C was 6.8 - above the diagnostic threshold. I previously had been told, as a child, that I had elevated GAD antibodies, which they reconfirmed at the time of diagnoses, which automatically put me in the T1 category. 

After running additional testing, they wanted to hold off on starting insulin right away, as I was hovering around 140-160 fasting glucose. They expected over the next few weeks my levels would rise, and I would need to start once I surpassed 200. That actually hasn‚Äôt changed much, and over 9 months later, nothing has particularly worsened, which my care team has said means I‚Äôm in an extended honeymoon period. The weird thing is that this team (now 6 different individuals at a pretty highly ranked research hospital) has never seen a honeymoon period like this.

They put me on a semiglutide indefinitely off-label in the hopes that it would prolong the honeymoon period even more. it has brought my A1C down quite a bit, and now my fasting glucose hovers around 95-105 every day. As an aside, it‚Äôs also helped with my PCOS symptoms immensely, as its commonly used to treat it off-label (I guess it can be effected by blood sugar?). The downside is the medication has pretty significant side effects that have hit me hard.

I realize that this is a good thing, and that I am extremely fortunate to be in good hands, but I don‚Äôt have a ton of comfort with the fact that I‚Äôm a big question mark to my team. It‚Äôs exciting for them, in their words, but I‚Äôm not loving the multiple appointments and tests per month to try and figure it out! I‚Äôve been told that no matter what, I will eventually need to take insulin, but as far as a timeline, they have nothing to benchmark me against.

Newly pump member,"Hello! 
I am a 25 year old female, who‚Äôs had diabetes for the last 13 years. I use to always use pens, I was scared of change- to have a device on me 24/7. In all- I grew to accept my diabetes as a part of who i am in the last couple of years. 
As when I was in my teen years..I neglected it soo soo badly to where I never knew what my numbers were, and I always just guestimated my dosage upon eying what I was eating‚Ä¶without even knowing what my sugars were already sitting at.
I know that is absolutely awful. And I just am so grateful that God didn‚Äôt have me pay the price for my negligence.
Within the last 5 years-
I began taking better care of my blood sugars to my best ability. However, that consisted of more finger pricks and more injections..still guesstimating insulin dosages and corrections. Then 2 years ago I went on the Libre which was so amazing to me because I didn‚Äôt even know of this such thing!!! 
Well, in September I had told my doctor how I want to family plan soon in hopes to be pregnant. She said I absolutely couldn‚Äôt at the time because my A1c was at at 8.5..to me I was crushed because I thought I was killing it! 
That was because of my poor track record with my A1c in the past, and the fact that I didn‚Äôt have much knowledge on A1c target numbers. She said I will need to work on my A1c..I didn‚Äôt know what more to do because I thought what I was doing was the best- as I always eat pretty clean, I exercise regularly..
I ended up 3 months later with a lower A1c but it was a ‚Äúcheat‚Äù because I was having WAY too many lows. 
Anyway ‚Äì after that conversation with my doctor since I was having too many lows at the time, she decided that I should switch over to Dexcom so I can on a continuous glucose monitoring system. I switched over around Christmas time- and Dexcom its self has been life changing. I check my bloodsugars too many times to count throughout the day. 
I then was able to try to monitor my numbers better, just at night was such a pain having to wake up at all different kind of hours because my phone was pinging me that my sugars were rising‚Ä¶which meant I had to inject myself. But it wasn‚Äôt long until I converted over to a pump !
Which was all a part of the plan in September to get my diabetes under control so I can begin family planning. 
I started the pump in mid April. I have the Tandem. I must say it was the best thing I have ever done for myself. I honestly should have taken this chance a long time  ago because I really didn't know what I was missing out on. The freedom you have with a pump, it feels so weightless. I feel like I am free of so many burdens, as Diabetes was defined as such an inconvenience in so many ways. I actually wake up and look forward to, trying to do better with my numbers each and every day. Yes, I do get discouraged, someday still, but I do look back and think about how every meal and every snack‚Ä¶ Even stress and hormonal changes would  cause me too have to stab myself with another needle. I was probably at at least six shots a day! 
Anyway, I took a look at the Clarity app and seeing how my blood sugars overall were today and I am just so happy. I am trying to lock down on having less peaks. I am wondering if there is any other advice that anyone has to do so? I already do pre-bolus before my meals for the most part‚Ä¶ I tried to do at least 15 minutes beforehand.

Venting about everything,"Hey everyone. I posted a while back around February or March about my son's recent diagnosis. It's been such a struggle. For some context, I'm a single mother with two children. My son was diagnosed when he went into DKA and nearly died. Just managing and trying to be there for him is exhausting, so I can't even fathom how hard it is for him and anyone that has this. 

The team of doctors that I thought were wonderful are really not, and and they basically threatened to kick my son out of the clinic if I decided to set his pump up with his pediatrician that can train me, since they require training for it to be with them during times of the week I can't make it because of work. I've taken a ton off already and I can't really afford to miss anymore work. I don't have time for hardly anything lately. It just disgusts me how horrible doctors can be. She said ""well technically he doesn't need a pump since it can be administered manually."" That might be true, but it's subjecting a child to a harder life because of some bs training that I can get at a time that works around my job. 

I also took him to see his doctor this afternoon and he's severely depressed and having suicidal ideations because of his diagnosis. 

This was at his regular pediatrician and not with the ""wonderful team"" of diabetic doctors. I have been begging them to get the psychologist they have to see him and schedule his appointment but I never get a call back. This was my last resort, and I'm so thankful she's at least kind enough to care.

Trying to reverse my ketosis at home. I'm frustrated.,"i'm not exactly sure of this sub's rules on swearing, so i'll keep it family-friendly, but believe me, I am beyond angry at absolutely everything right now. (tw for eating disorder, this is a sad one)

(17f, diagnosed in late february, using a dexcom g6 and doing MPI until my omnipod 5 training session next week)

a few weeks back, i completely lost my appetite and couldn't keep any food down (very reminiscent of how i felt back in february which we later learned was severe ketoacidosis that got me diagnosed). i have a history of a restrictive eating disorder that my endo is aware of, but wasn't in a bad headspace at the time and wasn't worrying quite so much about my weight. checked my ketones, negative. checked them a couple days later after no change, negative.

weeks go by and i'm just trying my hardest to function at work without being seen as a slacker after the resolution of some payment issues at my job. i'm eating maybe one small thing a day, and usually can't finish it. 

since my diagnosis is so new, i was in a honeymoon period when this started so i wasn't dosing quite as much for what i was able to eat. i stopped being able to take my basal long-acting insulin without going low at least 3-4 times a day, and when i did take fast-acting it would bring my sugars down like an aggressive rollercoaster drop into hell. i was frustrated, but i checked my ketones and again, nothing.

yesterday (july 4th), i checked my ketones again because it just keeps getting worse and finally, i come up with between 15-40 mg/dl. so finally, some answers. so i called the on-call diabetes nurse at the hospital i see my endo at, as instructed.

well, because i'm 17, i'm in pediatrics on a technicality. i call and they take a full 10 minutes to put my request through to the nurse because they assumed i was calling for my child and not for me, and had to re-enter all of the information. the nurse calls me back, and lo and behold, she treats me like a baby, telling me things that have been drilled into my brain since diagnosis in a way you would only use for young children. i tell her what i said above (in a more concise manner of course), and she basically just says to take enough carbs to justify dosing insulin because my blood sugar was around 119 at the time (not exact, because my dexcom has been running anywhere from 20-40 mg/dl above what my glucometer tests read) and to try taking antacids to help with the appetite issues that she thinks likely caused the lack of appetite in the first place.

i'm incredibly doubtful of her acid reflux theory as i've never had issues with it, and i'm frustrated and angry because i feel like i called just for them to state the very obvious, and i just want this to be over before i have to be hospitalized and feel the same way i did back in february. i thought i was dying. i had genuinely considered the possibility that i had cancer. that was the worst time of my life and i have had my fair share of struggles in this life so far. 

this feels so unfair and it's like i'm trapped in a prison of my own body. i have to do the work of one of my organs and because of that i'll never know quite what to expect from my body or how i'm going to feel on any given day. i feel like my life is ruined and i've felt this way since diagnosis. i am so filled with anger and resentment, mostly towards myself because this came out of nowhere. i'm the first in my family to have type 1. i feel hopeless and i don't know where to go. i'm angry i have to spend the rest of my life like this.

does anybody have any good advice on how to get through this without destroying my mind and my body? i don't want this to affect the long-term but i am so tired of hearing ""it's a learning curve"" and ""just wait until it gets better."" i know it's a long, difficult process. i just want to feel like there's hope for right now.

If you working super hard and not eating - then even a small amount of insulin will be very effective at taking sugar out of the blood and replenishing the muscles store of glucose( insulin sensitivity) and it can be easy to drop low, even with a small amount of insulin.', ""still can't hurt to talk about it imo, i've had digestive problems my whole life long before t1d so it's something i should be bringing up at this point anyway\n\n& believe me, i accepted my diagnosis right away. it's not that i haven't been taking care of it because i don't want to, i simply didn't know i could still go into dka just by not taking insulin when i wasn't eating. it was mostly just the way my doctors described it to me, they made it seem like dka was more about an excess of glucose than a lack of insulin"", 'oh my god i love the science that is actually so cool that you know that\n\ni only started out so high because i was diagnosed so recently. i was tested a couple days after coming out of dka, so my blood sugar was over 1000 at the time and they wanted to get me on a fuck ton of insulin right off the bat to combat it. originally my pcp put me on 12 units but when i was switched to my endo for my diabetes care they put me on 25 units and decreased it as i got into a normal range', 'That is good.

The long term effects of frequent lows,"I have had diabetes for 20 years now, my entire life. Meetings with my endo are brief and short, as my A1C is always between 5.5-7, it‚Äôs been lower recently and last year i was hospitalized for a low induced seizure, this being the 3rd total hospitalization in my life relating to diabetes, (counting the original diagnosis trip and another time when i was like 9 because i wasn‚Äôt switching injection sites frequently enough) and it was within the last year i started using a pump for the first time alongside a cgm.

But today i am on my 6th low (below 65mg/dl) and have recently become aware of the cognitive impacts and risks of frequent lows in diabetics. The way i interact with the disease favors lows, and has for a long time, i take advantage of lows to eat, and always have glucose ready to address it but it leads to very polarizing periods of ups and downs, which have been characterizing my experiences recently. I just don‚Äôt know how to deal with this now, after learning about the long term impacts of frequent lows (memory issues, and links Alzheimers and dementia characteristics) i have become paranoid, and come to a turn that i am most likely not managing this disease well at all.

Just rolled my ankle,"I rolled my ankle playing basketball and was wondering if there is anything new I should keep in mind and look out for.

GF Family Member Broke my Vial and Hid it,"TLDR: Someone stepped on my insulin after not paying attention, breaking a new vial and hid it from me and the family

I spent the holiday weekend with my girlfriend and her family. Today I needed to refill my cartridge and found my vial, inside the box, was smashed(It was a brand new, unused one). I was keeping it on the door of the fridge on a shelf. I usually keep it in the part that is smaller with the cover you can close, but that was filled with other things and I did not want to move them. The box looked completely destroyed and the vial was broken in 2 places, with all the insulin having leaked out. The box was stuffed underneath some coffee beans stored in a paper bag when I found it. My guess is that someone grabbed something from the shelf on the door which accidentally pulled my vial out, and then accidentally stepped on it. Then, whoever it was purposefully put it back and put the coffee over it to hide it, and told no one. I want to rip the whole family a new one, but unfortunately a family member passed away a few days ago and I do not want to add to those feelings.
