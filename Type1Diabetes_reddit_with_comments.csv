Coronavirus and T1D,"Edit 12/25 As of yesterday, I’m on my 3rd COVID diagnosis. I think I’ve just gotten unlucky (despite being vaccinated) and I’ve gotten all 3 variants lol

Hey y’all! I’m a type one, diagnosed 4ish years ago. I tested positive for coronavirus. I’m currently doing fine. But I wanted to post this, in case someone has concerns about coronavirus and it’s relation to diabetes. :) I want to be a resource for whoever needs it!

Edit:
How I got it: my dad had been sick during Easter weekend. But doctors told him he had a sinus infection. They went ahead and put an order in for him to get tested. I went back to my apartment near school. A few days later, the result cake back positive. So I knew I had been exposed. My mom also got sick. (They are currently recovering with no complications).

It would also probably be helpful to outline my symptoms and the whole timeline. So I will be updating this daily with any new symptoms.

I am currently on day 14 of symptoms.

Day 1: I had a weird mucousy cough. I have allergies so coughing is normal for me. But this felt different and it was a little more frequent. 

Day 2: I had a really bad headache along with the cough.

Day 3: I had a sore throat, the headache, and the cough. I also had joint pain. My doctor decided I should get tested because I had been directly exposed and I have diabetes. I went ahead and got tested that day. I took Tylenol to treat the headache and it worked fine.

Day 4: I just had a slight cough and a headache, but it wasn’t that bad. I started taking azithromycin to treat the respiratory symptoms. 

Day 5: I got my results and it was positive. I was told to complete the antibiotics, take Tylenol for the headache, take a prescription they gave me for the cough, and to continue taking multivitamins. 
At this point, I was able to feel my lungs if I took a deep breath. I compare it to the feeling you get when you run for a really long time. It’s like a slight pressure/cramp in your lungs. 
My old endocrinologist prescribed an inhaler (albuterol sulfate) just in case I end up needing it. 

Day 6: I had no bad symptoms. It’s mainly the symptom of feeling my lungs, coughing, and getting shortness of breath during talking a lot or walking around. I also lost my sense of smell and tastE for the most part.

Day 7: I have a cough, and pressure in my chest/lungs. I don’t know how I’d really describe it.

Day 8: I just have a cough and a little bit of pressure in my chest.

Day 9: I had a cough and my throat started feeling sore. My tonsils seem inflamed. My nose also has a burning sensation. It’s kind of weird to describe. 

Day 10: I have a cough. Same burning nose sensation. Shortness of breath. I lightly worked out with A LOT of breaks in between. 

Day 11: I have a cough and shortness of breath with tasks like going up stairs.

Day 12: I CAN SMELL AND TASTE AGAIN! I also talked to my nurse and she said because I haven’t had a fever in the last three days, my last positive test result was over a week ago, and my symptoms have improved, I no longer need to isolate from people in my house 🥳

Day 13: I feel great other than a cough. Slight shortness of breath.

Day 14: just a cough 🤩

Diabetes wise: my numbers are definitely harder to manage, but I’ve been doing a good job controlling it as much as possible. I have been doubling my boluses to try to keep my numbers from being high.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/g7ewx5/coronavirus_and_t1d/,I pinned this to the top of the page so that we'll all remember to check-in with your daily updates.

Day 7: I have a cough, and pressure in my chest/lungs. I don’t know how I’d really describe it.

Day 8: I just have a cough and a little bit of pressure in my chest.

Day 9: I had a cough and my throat started feeling sore. My tonsils seem inflamed. My nose also has a burning sensation. It’s kind of weird to describe. 

Day 10: I have a cough. Same burning nose sensation. Shortness of breath. I lightly worked out with A LOT of breaks in between. 

Day 11: I have a cough and shortness of breath with tasks like going up stairs.

Day 12: I CAN SMELL AND TASTE AGAIN! I also talked to my nurse and she said because I haven’t had a fever in the last three days, my last positive test result was over a week ago, and my symptoms have improved, I no longer need to isolate from people in my house 🥳

Day 13: I feel great other than a cough. Slight shortness of breath.

Day 14: just a cough 🤩

Hey y’all! I’m a type one, diagnosed 4ish years ago. I tested positive for coronavirus. I’m currently doing fine. But I wanted to post this, in case someone has concerns about coronavirus and it’s relation to diabetes. :) I want to be a resource for whoever needs it!

Edit:
How I got it: my dad had been sick during Easter weekend. But doctors told him he had a sinus infection. They went ahead and put an order in for him to get tested. I went back to my apartment near school. A few days later, the result cake back positive. So I knew I had been exposed. My mom also got sick. (They are currently recovering with no complications).

It would also probably be helpful to outline my symptoms and the whole timeline. So I will be updating this daily with any new symptoms.

I am currently on day 14 of symptoms.

Day 1: I had a weird mucousy cough. I have allergies so coughing is normal for me. But this felt different and it was a little more frequent. 

Day 2: I had a really bad headache along with the cough.

Day 3: I had a sore throat, the headache, and the cough. I also had joint pain. My doctor decided I should get tested because I had been directly exposed and I have diabetes. I went ahead and got tested that day. I took Tylenol to treat the headache and it worked fine.

Day 4: I just had a slight cough and a headache, but it wasn’t that bad. I started taking azithromycin to treat the respiratory symptoms. 

Day 5: I got my results and it was positive. I was told to complete the antibiotics, take Tylenol for the headache, take a prescription they gave me for the cough, and to continue taking multivitamins. 
At this point, I was able to feel my lungs if I took a deep breath. I compare it to the feeling you get when you run for a really long time. It’s like a slight pressure/cramp in your lungs.

I'm a 40+ year type 1 in good control, but not perfect.  A1C was 5.5 last time, but I still spike far too much than I'd like.  I figure that's due to metal instability, which is obviously worse with this situation.  And, yes, spike over 300 enough to bother me.  But, hearing that someone who is also in good control could handle this issue is a feel good situation.  I'm not banking that if I get Covid 19 that I will have similar results, but that similar is possible in at least a random outcome if nothing.  Thanks and good health to you in the future."

I had pizza for dinner last night and went high overnight, but usually my blood sugar stays over 160 or 170, I woke up with it at 120, It had peaked at 250 through the night though, with a sharp crash to baseline afterwards. I took no insulin for that.

Day 12: I CAN SMELL AND TASTE AGAIN! I also talked to my nurse and she said because I haven’t had a fever in the last three days, my last positive test result was over a week ago, and my symptoms have improved, I no longer need to isolate from people in my house 🥳

Day 13: I feel great other than a cough. Slight shortness of breath.

Day 14: just a cough 🤩

Coronavirus and T1D,"Edit 12/25 As of yesterday, I’m on my 3rd COVID diagnosis. I think I’ve just gotten unlucky (despite being vaccinated) and I’ve gotten all 3 variants lol

Hey y’all! I’m a type one, diagnosed 4ish years ago. I tested positive for coronavirus. I’m currently doing fine. But I wanted to post this, in case someone has concerns about coronavirus and it’s relation to diabetes. :) I want to be a resource for whoever needs it!

Edit:
How I got it: my dad had been sick during Easter weekend. But doctors told him he had a sinus infection. They went ahead and put an order in for him to get tested. I went back to my apartment near school. A few days later, the result cake back positive. So I knew I had been exposed. My mom also got sick. (They are currently recovering with no complications).

It would also probably be helpful to outline my symptoms and the whole timeline. So I will be updating this daily with any new symptoms.

I am currently on day 14 of symptoms.

Day 1: I had a weird mucousy cough. I have allergies so coughing is normal for me. But this felt different and it was a little more frequent. 

Day 2: I had a really bad headache along with the cough.

Day 3: I had a sore throat, the headache, and the cough. I also had joint pain. My doctor decided I should get tested because I had been directly exposed and I have diabetes. I went ahead and got tested that day. I took Tylenol to treat the headache and it worked fine.

Day 4: I just had a slight cough and a headache, but it wasn’t that bad. I started taking azithromycin to treat the respiratory symptoms. 

Day 5: I got my results and it was positive. I was told to complete the antibiotics, take Tylenol for the headache, take a prescription they gave me for the cough, and to continue taking multivitamins. 
At this point, I was able to feel my lungs if I took a deep breath. I compare it to the feeling you get when you run for a really long time. It’s like a slight pressure/cramp in your lungs. 
My old endocrinologist prescribed an inhaler (albuterol sulfate) just in case I end up needing it. 

Day 6: I had no bad symptoms. It’s mainly the symptom of feeling my lungs, coughing, and getting shortness of breath during talking a lot or walking around. I also lost my sense of smell and tastE for the most part.

Day 7: I have a cough, and pressure in my chest/lungs. I don’t know how I’d really describe it.

Day 8: I just have a cough and a little bit of pressure in my chest.

Day 9: I had a cough and my throat started feeling sore. My tonsils seem inflamed. My nose also has a burning sensation. It’s kind of weird to describe. 

Day 10: I have a cough. Same burning nose sensation. Shortness of breath. I lightly worked out with A LOT of breaks in between.

At this point, I was able to feel my lungs if I took a deep breath. I compare it to the feeling you get when you run for a really long time. It’s like a slight pressure/cramp in your lungs. 
My old endocrinologist prescribed an inhaler (albuterol sulfate) just in case I end up needing it. 

Day 6: I had no bad symptoms. It’s mainly the symptom of feeling my lungs, coughing, and getting shortness of breath during talking a lot or walking around. I also lost my sense of smell and tastE for the most part.

Day 7: I have a cough, and pressure in my chest/lungs. I don’t know how I’d really describe it.

Day 8: I just have a cough and a little bit of pressure in my chest.

Day 9: I had a cough and my throat started feeling sore. My tonsils seem inflamed. My nose also has a burning sensation. It’s kind of weird to describe. 

Day 10: I have a cough. Same burning nose sensation. Shortness of breath. I lightly worked out with A LOT of breaks in between. 

Day 11: I have a cough and shortness of breath with tasks like going up stairs.

Day 12: I CAN SMELL AND TASTE AGAIN! I also talked to my nurse and she said because I haven’t had a fever in the last three days, my last positive test result was over a week ago, and my symptoms have improved, I no longer need to isolate from people in my house 🥳

Day 13: I feel great other than a cough. Slight shortness of breath.

Day 14: just a cough 🤩

Coronavirus and T1D,"Edit 12/25 As of yesterday, I’m on my 3rd COVID diagnosis. I think I’ve just gotten unlucky (despite being vaccinated) and I’ve gotten all 3 variants lol

Hey y’all! I’m a type one, diagnosed 4ish years ago. I tested positive for coronavirus. I’m currently doing fine. But I wanted to post this, in case someone has concerns about coronavirus and it’s relation to diabetes. :) I want to be a resource for whoever needs it!

Edit:
How I got it: my dad had been sick during Easter weekend. But doctors told him he had a sinus infection. They went ahead and put an order in for him to get tested. I went back to my apartment near school. A few days later, the result cake back positive. So I knew I had been exposed. My mom also got sick. (They are currently recovering with no complications).

It would also probably be helpful to outline my symptoms and the whole timeline. So I will be updating this daily with any new symptoms.

I am currently on day 14 of symptoms.

Day 1: I had a weird mucousy cough. I have allergies so coughing is normal for me. But this felt different and it was a little more frequent. 

Day 2: I had a really bad headache along with the cough.

Day 3: I had a sore throat, the headache, and the cough. I also had joint pain. My doctor decided I should get tested because I had been directly exposed and I have diabetes. I went ahead and got tested that day. I took Tylenol to treat the headache and it worked fine.

Day 4: I just had a slight cough and a headache, but it wasn’t that bad. I started taking azithromycin to treat the respiratory symptoms.

Hey y’all! I’m a type one, diagnosed 4ish years ago. I tested positive for coronavirus. I’m currently doing fine. But I wanted to post this, in case someone has concerns about coronavirus and it’s relation to diabetes. :) I want to be a resource for whoever needs it!

Edit:
How I got it: my dad had been sick during Easter weekend. But doctors told him he had a sinus infection. They went ahead and put an order in for him to get tested. I went back to my apartment near school. A few days later, the result cake back positive. So I knew I had been exposed. My mom also got sick. (They are currently recovering with no complications).

It would also probably be helpful to outline my symptoms and the whole timeline. So I will be updating this daily with any new symptoms.

I am currently on day 14 of symptoms.

Day 1: I had a weird mucousy cough. I have allergies so coughing is normal for me. But this felt different and it was a little more frequent. 

Day 2: I had a really bad headache along with the cough.

Day 3: I had a sore throat, the headache, and the cough. I also had joint pain. My doctor decided I should get tested because I had been directly exposed and I have diabetes. I went ahead and got tested that day. I took Tylenol to treat the headache and it worked fine.

Day 4: I just had a slight cough and a headache, but it wasn’t that bad. I started taking azithromycin to treat the respiratory symptoms. 

Day 5: I got my results and it was positive. I was told to complete the antibiotics, take Tylenol for the headache, take a prescription they gave me for the cough, and to continue taking multivitamins. 
At this point, I was able to feel my lungs if I took a deep breath. I compare it to the feeling you get when you run for a really long time. It’s like a slight pressure/cramp in your lungs. 
My old endocrinologist prescribed an inhaler (albuterol sulfate) just in case I end up needing it. 

Day 6: I had no bad symptoms. It’s mainly the symptom of feeling my lungs, coughing, and getting shortness of breath during talking a lot or walking around. I also lost my sense of smell and tastE for the most part.

Day 7: I have a cough, and pressure in my chest/lungs. I don’t know how I’d really describe it.

Day 8: I just have a cough and a little bit of pressure in my chest.

Day 9: I had a cough and my throat started feeling sore. My tonsils seem inflamed. My nose also has a burning sensation. It’s kind of weird to describe. 

Day 10: I have a cough. Same burning nose sensation. Shortness of breath. I lightly worked out with A LOT of breaks in between. 

Day 11: I have a cough and shortness of breath with tasks like going up stairs.

Day 12: I CAN SMELL AND TASTE AGAIN! I also talked to my nurse and she said because I haven’t had a fever in the last three days, my last positive test result was over a week ago, and my symptoms have improved, I no longer need to isolate from people in my house 🥳

Day 13: I feel great other than a cough. Slight shortness of breath.

Day 14: just a cough 🤩

I've read about recent studies showing that low Vitamin D levels are associated with easier transmission, that the Tuberculosis vaccine has a positive effect on the severity of the illness, and that countries with MMR vaccines that extend to later years show a lower infection rate - which may explain why children are less affected by the virus (more recent MMR). 

Would you mind providing some details on your meds and vaccines? Do you take D supplements? Anything else? Have you had either of those vaccines? Do you know how recent?

Thanks"

Day 5: I got my results and it was positive. I was told to complete the antibiotics, take Tylenol for the headache, take a prescription they gave me for the cough, and to continue taking multivitamins. 
At this point, I was able to feel my lungs if I took a deep breath. I compare it to the feeling you get when you run for a really long time. It’s like a slight pressure/cramp in your lungs. 
My old endocrinologist prescribed an inhaler (albuterol sulfate) just in case I end up needing it. 

Day 6: I had no bad symptoms. It’s mainly the symptom of feeling my lungs, coughing, and getting shortness of breath during talking a lot or walking around. I also lost my sense of smell and tastE for the most part.

Day 7: I have a cough, and pressure in my chest/lungs. I don’t know how I’d really describe it.

Day 8: I just have a cough and a little bit of pressure in my chest.

Day 9: I had a cough and my throat started feeling sore. My tonsils seem inflamed. My nose also has a burning sensation. It’s kind of weird to describe. 

Day 10: I have a cough. Same burning nose sensation. Shortness of breath. I lightly worked out with A LOT of breaks in between. 

Day 11: I have a cough and shortness of breath with tasks like going up stairs.

Day 12: I CAN SMELL AND TASTE AGAIN! I also talked to my nurse and she said because I haven’t had a fever in the last three days, my last positive test result was over a week ago, and my symptoms have improved, I no longer need to isolate from people in my house 🥳

Day 13: I feel great other than a cough. Slight shortness of breath.

There is really no way to know how you will do. If you have any sort of micro or macro vascular issues, complications or are overweight if have terrible control (or other comorbidities or autoimmune issues) I’d say it’s doomsday but then again I have other (non D, non lifestyle) risk factors and was fine. 

Most young otherwise healthy T1s I wouldn’t lose too much sleep. Like anything there will always be someone who dies from the flu, a cold, a common infection etc underlying issues or not. Not much you can do, just live your life.

Personally I’d rather die rapidly from a viral infection than slowly from chronic disease. But that’s just me. Got to die from something. If D complications really any better? Never understood the panic TBH.

Don’t mask unless I must and only a cloth mask not a medical grade OHS fitted N95 switched out once an hour. So my mask does zero."

I have been doubling my boluses to try to keep my numbers from being high.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/g7ewx5/coronavirus_and_t1d/,"I don't know if my story will help but I'll share it.

I've been a diabetic for almost 15 years (I am now 29). I have had a spotted history of lung infections and in rare cases, pneumonia. I caught Covid-19 in the early days of the pandemic. I was sick for about a week and it passed without too much issue. My blood sugars during my battle with Covid-19 were unaffected, maybe even better than usual because I ate less.  I was sick, but still able to go about most daily activities without any problems. In the past, I have had flus and other infections send me to the hospital or at the very least have to use an inhaler for a short period of time while sick. I was lucky that Covid-19 wasn't effective at all against me. Testing didn't really exist at this time (it was early 2020), but I took multiple antibody tests later on that came back positive for Covid-19 infection. So, either this sickness was Covid-19 or I was completely asymptomatic when I was infected. That is HIGHLY unlikely based on how I react to most respiratory infections.

About 7 months back, I was forced to get the Covid-19 vaccine by my ex employers under threat of termination. I opted for the J&J shot, because I figured it was just one dose and I'd be rid of it. That ""vaccine"" lead to me being bed ridden for 3 weeks and having to visit the ER twice with severe breathing problems. It was by far the worst experience I have ever had with being sick. My blood sugars were wild, I wasn't eating, and my usually mild gastroparesis went absolutely nuts during this time and for about two months after recovery.  The gastroparesis also lead to me being unable to work for said ex employer which lead to them ""letting me go"". So, I was fired regardless.

Up until very recently, I have been having heart problems as well as increased anxiety. My vision at a distance has also noticeably decreased within the last 6 months. My doctors at Kaiser Permanente kept saying its just complications with diabetes. Strange that I wouldn't have any issues at all, ever, until this incident...right after this shot...but I digress.

I am now no longer with Kaiser Permanente as on January 1st and have joined a private practice. My gastro health has improved dramatically, I am working for a new company that allows working from home some days, and I have solid natural immunity despite the shot that almost killed me. I am on multiple natural supplements that have been scientifically proven to work against general infection and Covid-19 specifically. So far, I am having zero new issues and the issues that came from the shot have lessened dramatically. I am still having vision issues, but my heart problems have stopped and my anxiety is basically gone.

Again, don't know if this helps anyone, but I wanted to share my experience with Covid-19 being a diabetic. Maybe it'll stir up some conversation."

Hey y’all! I’m a type one, diagnosed 4ish years ago. I tested positive for coronavirus. I’m currently doing fine. But I wanted to post this, in case someone has concerns about coronavirus and it’s relation to diabetes. :) I want to be a resource for whoever needs it!

Edit:
How I got it: my dad had been sick during Easter weekend. But doctors told him he had a sinus infection. They went ahead and put an order in for him to get tested. I went back to my apartment near school. A few days later, the result cake back positive. So I knew I had been exposed. My mom also got sick. (They are currently recovering with no complications).

It would also probably be helpful to outline my symptoms and the whole timeline. So I will be updating this daily with any new symptoms.

I am currently on day 14 of symptoms.

Day 1: I had a weird mucousy cough. I have allergies so coughing is normal for me. But this felt different and it was a little more frequent. 

Day 2: I had a really bad headache along with the cough.

Day 3: I had a sore throat, the headache, and the cough. I also had joint pain. My doctor decided I should get tested because I had been directly exposed and I have diabetes. I went ahead and got tested that day. I took Tylenol to treat the headache and it worked fine.

Day 4: I just had a slight cough and a headache, but it wasn’t that bad. I started taking azithromycin to treat the respiratory symptoms. 

Day 5: I got my results and it was positive. I was told to complete the antibiotics, take Tylenol for the headache, take a prescription they gave me for the cough, and to continue taking multivitamins. 
At this point, I was able to feel my lungs if I took a deep breath. I compare it to the feeling you get when you run for a really long time. It’s like a slight pressure/cramp in your lungs. 
My old endocrinologist prescribed an inhaler (albuterol sulfate) just in case I end up needing it. 

Day 6: I had no bad symptoms. It’s mainly the symptom of feeling my lungs, coughing, and getting shortness of breath during talking a lot or walking around. I also lost my sense of smell and tastE for the most part.

Day 7: I have a cough, and pressure in my chest/lungs. I don’t know how I’d really describe it.

Day 8: I just have a cough and a little bit of pressure in my chest.

Day 9: I had a cough and my throat started feeling sore. My tonsils seem inflamed. My nose also has a burning sensation. It’s kind of weird to describe. 

Day 10: I have a cough. Same burning nose sensation. Shortness of breath. I lightly worked out with A LOT of breaks in between. 

Day 11: I have a cough and shortness of breath with tasks like going up stairs.

Day 12: I CAN SMELL AND TASTE AGAIN! I also talked to my nurse and she said because I haven’t had a fever in the last three days, my last positive test result was over a week ago, and my symptoms have improved, I no longer need to isolate from people in my house 🥳

Day 13: I feel great other than a cough. Slight shortness of breath.

Day 14: just a cough 🤩

Keep in mind your immune system is actually pretty solid if you are a type 1. Too much misinformation going around that T1 diabetics are fragile just because we have T1 diabetes. That is how you likely got T1 diabetes to begin with, by having a supercharged immune system. It attacked your pancreas and killed the beta cells. If you are a T2 diabetic then you have to seriously be careful."

Day 5: I got my results and it was positive. I was told to complete the antibiotics, take Tylenol for the headache, take a prescription they gave me for the cough, and to continue taking multivitamins. 
At this point, I was able to feel my lungs if I took a deep breath. I compare it to the feeling you get when you run for a really long time. It’s like a slight pressure/cramp in your lungs. 
My old endocrinologist prescribed an inhaler (albuterol sulfate) just in case I end up needing it. 

Day 6: I had no bad symptoms. It’s mainly the symptom of feeling my lungs, coughing, and getting shortness of breath during talking a lot or walking around. I also lost my sense of smell and tastE for the most part.

Day 7: I have a cough, and pressure in my chest/lungs. I don’t know how I’d really describe it.

Day 8: I just have a cough and a little bit of pressure in my chest.

Day 9: I had a cough and my throat started feeling sore. My tonsils seem inflamed. My nose also has a burning sensation. It’s kind of weird to describe. 

Day 10: I have a cough. Same burning nose sensation. Shortness of breath. I lightly worked out with A LOT of breaks in between. 

Day 11: I have a cough and shortness of breath with tasks like going up stairs.

Day 12: I CAN SMELL AND TASTE AGAIN! I also talked to my nurse and she said because I haven’t had a fever in the last three days, my last positive test result was over a week ago, and my symptoms have improved, I no longer need to isolate from people in my house 🥳

Day 13: I feel great other than a cough. Slight shortness of breath.

Day 14: just a cough 🤩

Day 11: I have a cough and shortness of breath with tasks like going up stairs.

Day 12: I CAN SMELL AND TASTE AGAIN! I also talked to my nurse and she said because I haven’t had a fever in the last three days, my last positive test result was over a week ago, and my symptoms have improved, I no longer need to isolate from people in my house 🥳

Hey y’all! I’m a type one, diagnosed 4ish years ago. I tested positive for coronavirus. I’m currently doing fine. But I wanted to post this, in case someone has concerns about coronavirus and it’s relation to diabetes. :) I want to be a resource for whoever needs it!

Edit:
How I got it: my dad had been sick during Easter weekend. But doctors told him he had a sinus infection. They went ahead and put an order in for him to get tested. I went back to my apartment near school. A few days later, the result cake back positive. So I knew I had been exposed. My mom also got sick. (They are currently recovering with no complications).

It would also probably be helpful to outline my symptoms and the whole timeline. So I will be updating this daily with any new symptoms.

I am currently on day 14 of symptoms.

Day 1: I had a weird mucousy cough. I have allergies so coughing is normal for me. But this felt different and it was a little more frequent. 

Day 2: I had a really bad headache along with the cough.

Day 3: I had a sore throat, the headache, and the cough. I also had joint pain. My doctor decided I should get tested because I had been directly exposed and I have diabetes. I went ahead and got tested that day. I took Tylenol to treat the headache and it worked fine.

Day 4: I just had a slight cough and a headache, but it wasn’t that bad. I started taking azithromycin to treat the respiratory symptoms. 

Day 5: I got my results and it was positive. I was told to complete the antibiotics, take Tylenol for the headache, take a prescription they gave me for the cough, and to continue taking multivitamins. 
At this point, I was able to feel my lungs if I took a deep breath. I compare it to the feeling you get when you run for a really long time. It’s like a slight pressure/cramp in your lungs. 
My old endocrinologist prescribed an inhaler (albuterol sulfate) just in case I end up needing it. 

Day 6: I had no bad symptoms. It’s mainly the symptom of feeling my lungs, coughing, and getting shortness of breath during talking a lot or walking around. I also lost my sense of smell and tastE for the most part.

Coronavirus and T1D,"Edit 12/25 As of yesterday, I’m on my 3rd COVID diagnosis. I think I’ve just gotten unlucky (despite being vaccinated) and I’ve gotten all 3 variants lol

Hey y’all! I’m a type one, diagnosed 4ish years ago. I tested positive for coronavirus. I’m currently doing fine. But I wanted to post this, in case someone has concerns about coronavirus and it’s relation to diabetes. :) I want to be a resource for whoever needs it!

Edit:
How I got it: my dad had been sick during Easter weekend. But doctors told him he had a sinus infection. They went ahead and put an order in for him to get tested. I went back to my apartment near school. A few days later, the result cake back positive. So I knew I had been exposed. My mom also got sick. (They are currently recovering with no complications).

It would also probably be helpful to outline my symptoms and the whole timeline. So I will be updating this daily with any new symptoms.

I am currently on day 14 of symptoms.

Day 1: I had a weird mucousy cough. I have allergies so coughing is normal for me. But this felt different and it was a little more frequent. 

Day 2: I had a really bad headache along with the cough.

Day 3: I had a sore throat, the headache, and the cough. I also had joint pain. My doctor decided I should get tested because I had been directly exposed and I have diabetes. I went ahead and got tested that day. I took Tylenol to treat the headache and it worked fine.

Day 4: I just had a slight cough and a headache, but it wasn’t that bad. I started taking azithromycin to treat the respiratory symptoms. 

Day 5: I got my results and it was positive. I was told to complete the antibiotics, take Tylenol for the headache, take a prescription they gave me for the cough, and to continue taking multivitamins. 
At this point, I was able to feel my lungs if I took a deep breath. I compare it to the feeling you get when you run for a really long time. It’s like a slight pressure/cramp in your lungs. 
My old endocrinologist prescribed an inhaler (albuterol sulfate) just in case I end up needing it. 

Day 6: I had no bad symptoms. It’s mainly the symptom of feeling my lungs, coughing, and getting shortness of breath during talking a lot or walking around. I also lost my sense of smell and tastE for the most part.

Day 7: I have a cough, and pressure in my chest/lungs. I don’t know how I’d really describe it.

Day 8: I just have a cough and a little bit of pressure in my chest.

Day 9: I had a cough and my throat started feeling sore. My tonsils seem inflamed. My nose also has a burning sensation. It’s kind of weird to describe. 

Day 10: I have a cough. Same burning nose sensation. Shortness of breath. I lightly worked out with A LOT of breaks in between. 

Day 11: I have a cough and shortness of breath with tasks like going up stairs.

Day 12: I CAN SMELL AND TASTE AGAIN! I also talked to my nurse and she said because I haven’t had a fever in the last three days, my last positive test result was over a week ago, and my symptoms have improved, I no longer need to isolate from people in my house 🥳

At this point, I was able to feel my lungs if I took a deep breath. I compare it to the feeling you get when you run for a really long time. It’s like a slight pressure/cramp in your lungs. 
My old endocrinologist prescribed an inhaler (albuterol sulfate) just in case I end up needing it. 

Day 6: I had no bad symptoms. It’s mainly the symptom of feeling my lungs, coughing, and getting shortness of breath during talking a lot or walking around. I also lost my sense of smell and tastE for the most part.

Day 7: I have a cough, and pressure in my chest/lungs. I don’t know how I’d really describe it.

Day 8: I just have a cough and a little bit of pressure in my chest.

Day 9: I had a cough and my throat started feeling sore. My tonsils seem inflamed. My nose also has a burning sensation. It’s kind of weird to describe. 

Day 10: I have a cough. Same burning nose sensation. Shortness of breath. I lightly worked out with A LOT of breaks in between. 

Day 11: I have a cough and shortness of breath with tasks like going up stairs.

Day 12: I CAN SMELL AND TASTE AGAIN! I also talked to my nurse and she said because I haven’t had a fever in the last three days, my last positive test result was over a week ago, and my symptoms have improved, I no longer need to isolate from people in my house 🥳

Day 13: I feel great other than a cough. Slight shortness of breath.

Day 14: just a cough 🤩

Coronavirus and T1D,"Edit 12/25 As of yesterday, I’m on my 3rd COVID diagnosis. I think I’ve just gotten unlucky (despite being vaccinated) and I’ve gotten all 3 variants lol

Hey y’all! I’m a type one, diagnosed 4ish years ago. I tested positive for coronavirus. I’m currently doing fine. But I wanted to post this, in case someone has concerns about coronavirus and it’s relation to diabetes. :) I want to be a resource for whoever needs it!

Edit:
How I got it: my dad had been sick during Easter weekend. But doctors told him he had a sinus infection. They went ahead and put an order in for him to get tested. I went back to my apartment near school. A few days later, the result cake back positive. So I knew I had been exposed. My mom also got sick. (They are currently recovering with no complications).

It would also probably be helpful to outline my symptoms and the whole timeline. So I will be updating this daily with any new symptoms.

I am currently on day 14 of symptoms.

Day 1: I had a weird mucousy cough. I have allergies so coughing is normal for me. But this felt different and it was a little more frequent. 

Day 2: I had a really bad headache along with the cough.

Day 3: I had a sore throat, the headache, and the cough. I also had joint pain. My doctor decided I should get tested because I had been directly exposed and I have diabetes. I went ahead and got tested that day. I took Tylenol to treat the headache and it worked fine.

It’s entirely possible your body fought back harder than average and you’ve got some residual action.

I used to routinely get situations like this, periods of not needing any insulin for massive amounts of carbs, constant unexplained lows etc. I am T1 since age 1-2, negative for MODY, etc etc."
Coronavirus and T1D,"Edit 12/25 As of yesterday, I’m on my 3rd COVID diagnosis. I think I’ve just gotten unlucky (despite being vaccinated) and I’ve gotten all 3 variants lol

Hey y’all! I’m a type one, diagnosed 4ish years ago. I tested positive for coronavirus. I’m currently doing fine. But I wanted to post this, in case someone has concerns about coronavirus and it’s relation to diabetes. :) I want to be a resource for whoever needs it!

Edit:
How I got it: my dad had been sick during Easter weekend. But doctors told him he had a sinus infection. They went ahead and put an order in for him to get tested. I went back to my apartment near school. A few days later, the result cake back positive. So I knew I had been exposed. My mom also got sick. (They are currently recovering with no complications).

It would also probably be helpful to outline my symptoms and the whole timeline. So I will be updating this daily with any new symptoms.

I am currently on day 14 of symptoms.

Day 1: I had a weird mucousy cough. I have allergies so coughing is normal for me. But this felt different and it was a little more frequent. 

Day 2: I had a really bad headache along with the cough.

Day 3: I had a sore throat, the headache, and the cough. I also had joint pain. My doctor decided I should get tested because I had been directly exposed and I have diabetes. I went ahead and got tested that day. I took Tylenol to treat the headache and it worked fine.

Day 4: I just had a slight cough and a headache, but it wasn’t that bad. I started taking azithromycin to treat the respiratory symptoms. 

Day 5: I got my results and it was positive. I was told to complete the antibiotics, take Tylenol for the headache, take a prescription they gave me for the cough, and to continue taking multivitamins. 
At this point, I was able to feel my lungs if I took a deep breath. I compare it to the feeling you get when you run for a really long time. It’s like a slight pressure/cramp in your lungs. 
My old endocrinologist prescribed an inhaler (albuterol sulfate) just in case I end up needing it. 

Day 6: I had no bad symptoms. It’s mainly the symptom of feeling my lungs, coughing, and getting shortness of breath during talking a lot or walking around. I also lost my sense of smell and tastE for the most part.

Day 7: I have a cough, and pressure in my chest/lungs. I don’t know how I’d really describe it.

Day 8: I just have a cough and a little bit of pressure in my chest.

Day 9: I had a cough and my throat started feeling sore. My tonsils seem inflamed. My nose also has a burning sensation. It’s kind of weird to describe. 

Day 10: I have a cough. Same burning nose sensation. Shortness of breath. I lightly worked out with A LOT of breaks in between. 

Day 11: I have a cough and shortness of breath with tasks like going up stairs.

Day 12: I CAN SMELL AND TASTE AGAIN! I also talked to my nurse and she said because I haven’t had a fever in the last three days, my last positive test result was over a week ago, and my symptoms have improved, I no longer need to isolate from people in my house 🥳

Day 13: I feel great other than a cough. Slight shortness of breath.

Day 14: just a cough 🤩

At this point, I was able to feel my lungs if I took a deep breath. I compare it to the feeling you get when you run for a really long time. It’s like a slight pressure/cramp in your lungs. 
My old endocrinologist prescribed an inhaler (albuterol sulfate) just in case I end up needing it. 

Day 6: I had no bad symptoms. It’s mainly the symptom of feeling my lungs, coughing, and getting shortness of breath during talking a lot or walking around. I also lost my sense of smell and tastE for the most part.

Day 7: I have a cough, and pressure in my chest/lungs. I don’t know how I’d really describe it.

Day 8: I just have a cough and a little bit of pressure in my chest.

Day 9: I had a cough and my throat started feeling sore. My tonsils seem inflamed. My nose also has a burning sensation. It’s kind of weird to describe. 

Day 10: I have a cough. Same burning nose sensation. Shortness of breath. I lightly worked out with A LOT of breaks in between. 

Day 11: I have a cough and shortness of breath with tasks like going up stairs.

Day 12: I CAN SMELL AND TASTE AGAIN! I also talked to my nurse and she said because I haven’t had a fever in the last three days, my last positive test result was over a week ago, and my symptoms have improved, I no longer need to isolate from people in my house 🥳

Day 13: I feel great other than a cough. Slight shortness of breath.

Day 14: just a cough 🤩

Diabetes wise: my numbers are definitely harder to manage, but I’ve been doing a good job controlling it as much as possible.

Hey y’all! I’m a type one, diagnosed 4ish years ago. I tested positive for coronavirus. I’m currently doing fine. But I wanted to post this, in case someone has concerns about coronavirus and it’s relation to diabetes. :) I want to be a resource for whoever needs it!

Edit:
How I got it: my dad had been sick during Easter weekend. But doctors told him he had a sinus infection. They went ahead and put an order in for him to get tested. I went back to my apartment near school. A few days later, the result cake back positive. So I knew I had been exposed. My mom also got sick. (They are currently recovering with no complications).

It would also probably be helpful to outline my symptoms and the whole timeline. So I will be updating this daily with any new symptoms.

I am currently on day 14 of symptoms.

Day 1: I had a weird mucousy cough. I have allergies so coughing is normal for me. But this felt different and it was a little more frequent. 

Day 2: I had a really bad headache along with the cough.

Day 3: I had a sore throat, the headache, and the cough. I also had joint pain. My doctor decided I should get tested because I had been directly exposed and I have diabetes. I went ahead and got tested that day. I took Tylenol to treat the headache and it worked fine.

Hey y’all! I’m a type one, diagnosed 4ish years ago. I tested positive for coronavirus. I’m currently doing fine. But I wanted to post this, in case someone has concerns about coronavirus and it’s relation to diabetes. :) I want to be a resource for whoever needs it!

Edit:
How I got it: my dad had been sick during Easter weekend. But doctors told him he had a sinus infection. They went ahead and put an order in for him to get tested. I went back to my apartment near school. A few days later, the result cake back positive. So I knew I had been exposed. My mom also got sick. (They are currently recovering with no complications).

It would also probably be helpful to outline my symptoms and the whole timeline. So I will be updating this daily with any new symptoms.

I am currently on day 14 of symptoms.

Day 1: I had a weird mucousy cough. I have allergies so coughing is normal for me. But this felt different and it was a little more frequent. 

Day 2: I had a really bad headache along with the cough.

Day 3: I had a sore throat, the headache, and the cough. I also had joint pain. My doctor decided I should get tested because I had been directly exposed and I have diabetes. I went ahead and got tested that day. I took Tylenol to treat the headache and it worked fine.

Day 4: I just had a slight cough and a headache, but it wasn’t that bad. I started taking azithromycin to treat the respiratory symptoms. 

Day 5: I got my results and it was positive. I was told to complete the antibiotics, take Tylenol for the headache, take a prescription they gave me for the cough, and to continue taking multivitamins. 
At this point, I was able to feel my lungs if I took a deep breath. I compare it to the feeling you get when you run for a really long time. It’s like a slight pressure/cramp in your lungs. 
My old endocrinologist prescribed an inhaler (albuterol sulfate) just in case I end up needing it. 

Day 6: I had no bad symptoms. It’s mainly the symptom of feeling my lungs, coughing, and getting shortness of breath during talking a lot or walking around. I also lost my sense of smell and tastE for the most part.

Day 7: I have a cough, and pressure in my chest/lungs. I don’t know how I’d really describe it.

Day 8: I just have a cough and a little bit of pressure in my chest.

Day 9: I had a cough and my throat started feeling sore. My tonsils seem inflamed. My nose also has a burning sensation. It’s kind of weird to describe. 

Day 10: I have a cough. Same burning nose sensation. Shortness of breath. I lightly worked out with A LOT of breaks in between. 

Day 11: I have a cough and shortness of breath with tasks like going up stairs.

Day 12: I CAN SMELL AND TASTE AGAIN! I also talked to my nurse and she said because I haven’t had a fever in the last three days, my last positive test result was over a week ago, and my symptoms have improved, I no longer need to isolate from people in my house 🥳

Day 13: I feel great other than a cough. Slight shortness of breath.

Day 14: just a cough 🤩

Day 9: I had a cough and my throat started feeling sore. My tonsils seem inflamed. My nose also has a burning sensation. It’s kind of weird to describe. 

Day 10: I have a cough. Same burning nose sensation. Shortness of breath. I lightly worked out with A LOT of breaks in between. 

Day 11: I have a cough and shortness of breath with tasks like going up stairs.

Day 12: I CAN SMELL AND TASTE AGAIN! I also talked to my nurse and she said because I haven’t had a fever in the last three days, my last positive test result was over a week ago, and my symptoms have improved, I no longer need to isolate from people in my house 🥳

Day 13: I feel great other than a cough. Slight shortness of breath.

Day 14: just a cough 🤩

Hey y’all! I’m a type one, diagnosed 4ish years ago. I tested positive for coronavirus. I’m currently doing fine. But I wanted to post this, in case someone has concerns about coronavirus and it’s relation to diabetes. :) I want to be a resource for whoever needs it!

Edit:
How I got it: my dad had been sick during Easter weekend. But doctors told him he had a sinus infection. They went ahead and put an order in for him to get tested. I went back to my apartment near school. A few days later, the result cake back positive. So I knew I had been exposed. My mom also got sick. (They are currently recovering with no complications).

It would also probably be helpful to outline my symptoms and the whole timeline. So I will be updating this daily with any new symptoms.

I am currently on day 14 of symptoms.

Day 1: I had a weird mucousy cough. I have allergies so coughing is normal for me. But this felt different and it was a little more frequent. 

Day 2: I had a really bad headache along with the cough.

Day 3: I had a sore throat, the headache, and the cough. I also had joint pain. My doctor decided I should get tested because I had been directly exposed and I have diabetes. I went ahead and got tested that day. I took Tylenol to treat the headache and it worked fine.

Day 4: I just had a slight cough and a headache, but it wasn’t that bad. I started taking azithromycin to treat the respiratory symptoms. 

Day 5: I got my results and it was positive. I was told to complete the antibiotics, take Tylenol for the headache, take a prescription they gave me for the cough, and to continue taking multivitamins. 
At this point, I was able to feel my lungs if I took a deep breath. I compare it to the feeling you get when you run for a really long time. It’s like a slight pressure/cramp in your lungs. 
My old endocrinologist prescribed an inhaler (albuterol sulfate) just in case I end up needing it. 

Day 6: I had no bad symptoms. It’s mainly the symptom of feeling my lungs, coughing, and getting shortness of breath during talking a lot or walking around. I also lost my sense of smell and tastE for the most part.

Day 7: I have a cough, and pressure in my chest/lungs. I don’t know how I’d really describe it.

I have my partner and my dogs and cat and I still try to get outside and do things in spread out areas or backyards of family members following extreme social distancing measures, but the only place I’ve been inside of other than my house was the dentist for an emergency procedure. I’m trying to read more, spend more times on crafting and other creative projects/hobbies, and I’ve been spending more time on Reddit trying to “socialize” that way. Which is probably why this is turning into a novel lol. 

Anyway, curious as to when you (or anyone else in a similar situation!) are planning on trying to go out again? Are you waiting for a vaccine? Or if numbers start really going down would you be comfortable trying to go to the store or something like that? It is way too earlier to think about it yet, but I’m not sure what is actually safe for us."

I wouldn’t be scared to go eat outdoors and live your life. Just keep your distance from sick people and wear an N95 indoors. I only got it because I went to a few indoor bars last weekend. I think eating outdoors at a restaurant is actually pretty therapeutic and makes you feel like a human again. It’s relatively safe and you could always ask your server to wear a mask because you’re immunocompromised. I’m sure they’d understand and you could tell them you’ll give them a bigger tip.

Coronavirus and T1D,"Edit 12/25 As of yesterday, I’m on my 3rd COVID diagnosis. I think I’ve just gotten unlucky (despite being vaccinated) and I’ve gotten all 3 variants lol

Hey y’all! I’m a type one, diagnosed 4ish years ago. I tested positive for coronavirus. I’m currently doing fine. But I wanted to post this, in case someone has concerns about coronavirus and it’s relation to diabetes. :) I want to be a resource for whoever needs it!

Edit:
How I got it: my dad had been sick during Easter weekend. But doctors told him he had a sinus infection. They went ahead and put an order in for him to get tested. I went back to my apartment near school. A few days later, the result cake back positive. So I knew I had been exposed. My mom also got sick. (They are currently recovering with no complications).

It would also probably be helpful to outline my symptoms and the whole timeline. So I will be updating this daily with any new symptoms.

I am currently on day 14 of symptoms.

Day 1: I had a weird mucousy cough. I have allergies so coughing is normal for me. But this felt different and it was a little more frequent. 

Day 2: I had a really bad headache along with the cough.

Day 3: I had a sore throat, the headache, and the cough. I also had joint pain. My doctor decided I should get tested because I had been directly exposed and I have diabetes. I went ahead and got tested that day. I took Tylenol to treat the headache and it worked fine.

Day 4: I just had a slight cough and a headache, but it wasn’t that bad. I started taking azithromycin to treat the respiratory symptoms. 

Day 5: I got my results and it was positive. I was told to complete the antibiotics, take Tylenol for the headache, take a prescription they gave me for the cough, and to continue taking multivitamins. 
At this point, I was able to feel my lungs if I took a deep breath. I compare it to the feeling you get when you run for a really long time. It’s like a slight pressure/cramp in your lungs. 
My old endocrinologist prescribed an inhaler (albuterol sulfate) just in case I end up needing it. 

Day 6: I had no bad symptoms. It’s mainly the symptom of feeling my lungs, coughing, and getting shortness of breath during talking a lot or walking around. I also lost my sense of smell and tastE for the most part.

Day 7: I have a cough, and pressure in my chest/lungs. I don’t know how I’d really describe it.

Day 8: I just have a cough and a little bit of pressure in my chest.

Day 9: I had a cough and my throat started feeling sore. My tonsils seem inflamed. My nose also has a burning sensation. It’s kind of weird to describe. 

Day 10: I have a cough. Same burning nose sensation. Shortness of breath. I lightly worked out with A LOT of breaks in between. 

Day 11: I have a cough and shortness of breath with tasks like going up stairs.

Day 12: I CAN SMELL AND TASTE AGAIN! I also talked to my nurse and she said because I haven’t had a fever in the last three days, my last positive test result was over a week ago, and my symptoms have improved, I no longer need to isolate from people in my house 🥳

At this point, I was able to feel my lungs if I took a deep breath. I compare it to the feeling you get when you run for a really long time. It’s like a slight pressure/cramp in your lungs. 
My old endocrinologist prescribed an inhaler (albuterol sulfate) just in case I end up needing it. 

Day 6: I had no bad symptoms. It’s mainly the symptom of feeling my lungs, coughing, and getting shortness of breath during talking a lot or walking around. I also lost my sense of smell and tastE for the most part.

Day 7: I have a cough, and pressure in my chest/lungs. I don’t know how I’d really describe it.

Day 8: I just have a cough and a little bit of pressure in my chest.

Day 9: I had a cough and my throat started feeling sore. My tonsils seem inflamed. My nose also has a burning sensation. It’s kind of weird to describe. 

Day 10: I have a cough. Same burning nose sensation. Shortness of breath. I lightly worked out with A LOT of breaks in between. 

Day 11: I have a cough and shortness of breath with tasks like going up stairs.

Day 12: I CAN SMELL AND TASTE AGAIN! I also talked to my nurse and she said because I haven’t had a fever in the last three days, my last positive test result was over a week ago, and my symptoms have improved, I no longer need to isolate from people in my house 🥳

Day 13: I feel great other than a cough. Slight shortness of breath.

Day 14: just a cough 🤩

Diabetes wise: my numbers are definitely harder to manage, but I’ve been doing a good job controlling it as much as possible.

I’d also try to get a pump if that’s something you guys are interested in and if insurance covers it. It definitely helps with control and it’s less exhausting to deal with diabetes and life.

Hey y’all! I’m a type one, diagnosed 4ish years ago. I tested positive for coronavirus. I’m currently doing fine. But I wanted to post this, in case someone has concerns about coronavirus and it’s relation to diabetes. :) I want to be a resource for whoever needs it!

Edit:
How I got it: my dad had been sick during Easter weekend. But doctors told him he had a sinus infection. They went ahead and put an order in for him to get tested. I went back to my apartment near school. A few days later, the result cake back positive. So I knew I had been exposed. My mom also got sick. (They are currently recovering with no complications).

It would also probably be helpful to outline my symptoms and the whole timeline. So I will be updating this daily with any new symptoms.

I am currently on day 14 of symptoms.

Day 1: I had a weird mucousy cough. I have allergies so coughing is normal for me. But this felt different and it was a little more frequent. 

Day 2: I had a really bad headache along with the cough.

Day 3: I had a sore throat, the headache, and the cough. I also had joint pain. My doctor decided I should get tested because I had been directly exposed and I have diabetes. I went ahead and got tested that day. I took Tylenol to treat the headache and it worked fine.

I need to rant!,"So I’m currently in hospital for something that isn’t related to my diabetes. I have relatively good control over my diabetes, even while I’ve been on and off steroid medication for another illness I’m battling. 

Why can’t the nurses understand basic Type 1 diabetes? How many times do I have to tell them that I don’t take my fast acting (Novorapid) at set times during the day? I’m not eating lunch until 1:30, why are you trying to get me to inject my insulin at 12?? 

One of the nurses even tried to tell me off for taking insulin for my dinner when I was 4.1! She said “that’s too low for taking any insulin, you shouldn’t take your insulin until it goes back to 12.0.” 

I had to explain that my normal range is between 5.0-9.0, but because I’m taking steroids again they’re running slightly higher and I was actually very pleased that my sugars had remained steady at 4.1. I further explained that 4.1 isn’t a hypo for me, sure it’s on the lower side but I was pretty chuffed with it! I then had to explain again that I’m about to eat my lunch, I NEED to have my insulin regardless or my sugars will spike too high. 

This nurse just couldn’t grasp this at all! 

Honestly the knowledge some nurses have of Type 1 is appalling. I understand not everyone has extensive knowledge of it, but this is just dangerous!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14w2p1v/i_need_to_rant/,"My little guy (2) was diagnosed in February. I sadly passed it along and have been type 1 for 28 years...the guilt kills me. We are in the hospital, and his blood sugar is 92, and he's nibbled on a couple slices of carrot, and  some chicken. The nurse comes in and just wants to blindly dose based on what the doctors told her to give at meals. I stopped her and said that he's at a normal range, and hasn't had any measurable amount of carbs, so don't give him insulin right now. She said she had to ask the doctor. She came back and said that no insulin right now was fine. I had to have a talk with them. If they had dosed without actually accounting for what he was eating, we'd be fighting a low in no time. All of this while on a floor for his new diagnosis. It really made me wonder what parents, who are brand new to all of this, have to deal with."

I called the nurse and told her she needed to turn off the intravenous insulin they had me on. She rolled her eyes and told me my levels were fine when she checked. I explained that I had checked on my CGM and they were now too low. She asked me how I knew it was accurate, so I suggested that she test me again using the hospital equipment. She said “but it’s not time”. I again asked her to turn off the intravenous insulin. She said she would call for a doctor. I asked how long the doctor would take and she said she didn’t know as they were on their rounds. At that point I lost my shit and yelled “I do not want to go into a coma and risk brain damage waiting for a doctor because you won’t listen!”.

The knowledge the general medical community has around diabetes, *regardless of type*, is appalling. The things I read about endocrinologists doing in this sub shock me time & time again. ""Your a1c is too low"" ""But doc, I have less than 2% low episodes in the last 90 days of my CGM clarity report"" ""don't care, too low, make your blood sugar higher"" - WHAT?! no logic - just doing what they've always done because that's the way it's been.

There's reasons for it, such as stigma/fatphobia perpetuated by media (& [often t1s](https://www.instagram.com/p/CuSWkUmNBc2/)) // the history of medicine/[racism-especially related to Diabetes & body composition in Amuricah](https://www.marcusbooks.com/book/9780300274226), plus the true complexity of the disease and the individual nature of each person's approach to their diabetes care. I've heard nurse friends mention that they have one little section in their years of schooling that touches on D-and what it touches on is complete shit. [A lot of nurses also think 1u is not worth dosing](https://www.instagram.com/p/CbTrvKHjMO5/) (because they have to jump through a lot of hoops to get insulin due to the fatal nature if too much, but...I'm not sure this really helps us vs. keeps the hospital out of lawsuits......

It’s not always our faults to be honest (although sometimes it is……)

We have a very strict protocol that we have to follow, and trying to get orders for insulin from doctors and residents is like pulling teeth (unless they’re endo, they don’t know much either tbh). It’s very difficult because for the most part, diseases are treated similarly and the treatments are easily titratable.

Diabetes is a huge exception. Patients are so different in terms of sensitivity, symptoms, reactivity, etc. what works for one does not work for all. But that’s not how most things work in medicine. So we’re not really taught that way. 

Plus technology and research in type 1 is all still very fresh. Considering 100 years ago it was a death sentence, and my uncle who got it in the 70s was testing his glucose with urine dipsticks, the treatments are still constantly evolving. The hospital I used to work at was insanely frustrating. They didn’t have a titratable meal bolus protocol, only a correction bolus one. So if your patient is 14.2 before their lunch, you correct for the 14.2 and that’s all. Oh what a surprise!!! They’re still 13.8 at dinner. Better correct it!! But no meal bolus!!! Literally chasing high blood sugars. And sometimes this worked for the type 2s but not the type 1s

Idk. I could rant about type 1 diabetes in the general health care system and hospitals for hours lol. It’s very frustrating. I do what I can to advocate for my patients as much as possible!"

I had my Humalog pen with me when I went in, but my basal was back at the hotel so I had to have them prescribe it for me. One of the nurses saw me doing a fingerstick and told me they were supposed to do it. I flat out said no way were they handling my T1 care. At dinner time, they tried to tell me I needed their Humalog and I should bolus according to their instruction. I told the nurses that if they didn't like me handling my own T1 care, they could turn around so they didn't have to see it. The NP on duty came in and said it would be highly irregular for me to be in charge of my own care and I told her I wasn't there to have my T1 looked after, I was there so they could figure out the chest pains, and if they tried to change anything it would likely cause a dangerous situation with my BG and I would have to correct it myself anyway. She seemed OK with that answer, but she didn't really like it. I didn't care. I am in charge of my care, not my doctor, not an endo, not anybody else.

My daughter was diagnosed after a bad dka. I called an ambulance when she went unconscious and unresponsive. Her bg was close to 400 in the ambulance and they kept thinking she od'd. They ended up life flighting her to our closest children's hospital and by that time her bg was 600+ and they still kept asking if she took any drugs. When her bg didn't come down immediately after starting insulin they wanted to give her narcan because they still thought she overdosed. And by this time they knew she had large ketones and her a1c was 14+. Once we got to children's it was like night and day.

Health Insurance Advice,"Hey fellow diabetics.

HELP.

I am on Medicaid and I'm really sick of it. I'm sick of having to work limited hours and low paid jobs simply to qualify for income limits.

I want to work, save up, thrive. I don't want to have to destroy my RX coverage in order to do this. 

I'm on: Dexcom, Fiasp, Toujeo. I also obviously visit doctors and specialists. Paying large copays or paying out of pocket due to lack of coverage would hurt my health and finances. I'm so sick of having to choose. 

Can anyone share real life solutions they've found? Insurance plans that don't suck?  Maybe a large company with decent healthcare plans? I need to work remotely for a variety of reasons, and I'm just at the end of my rope. 

Has anyone found a non profit or something that helps people navigate this?  It's weird and hard to try to see EXACTLY what would be covered and what copays would cost....on a job interview. 

I live in the US, which you've all probably guessed by now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14w78vx/health_insurance_advice/,"Public university systems tend to have decent insurance.  Some have embraced remote work for some job functions.  Corporate plans vary widely.  A typical plan might be $100/month premium with a $2000 deductible and a $6000 out of pocket max with $20-$50 copays for office visits and $25-$50 copays for prescriptions.

Unfortunately you won't find out specifics until you have a job offer.  Without specific plan info it's impossible to compare plans.  The public market plans available in your state are online.  You can at least look over those."

Find out if you can get it from an actual pharmacy like Walgreens or the mail order pharmacy your insurance uses - the same place you’d use if you needed cholesterol meds or your insulin.

My 1st pregnancy, I was 17. It had to be a secret. So as you can imagine, I didn’t ask for help. I started passing out all the time. It was very hard. I thought I was going to die or something very bad would happen to me. This was all because the insulin needs drop drastically in the first trimester and start to increase through the rest of the pregnancy. I gave birth and everything went back to normal (pre pregnancy state) in regards to my diabetes. 

My 2nd child was much easier. I had a few fainting spells but not almost everyday like my 1st. I went through this pregnancy with more knowledge. 

My 3rd baby was the easiest breeziest pregnancy I’ve ever had physically. I didn’t faint once. I had moments of delusions from lows but I always always always had something with sugar in it to help me get back up. Always. It’s a terrible idea to leave the house with nothing is what I had learned. 

Pregnancy is hard. Type 1 diabetes is hard. Pregnancy with Type 1 diabetes is extremely hard. But it’s so rewarding in the end. You will feel the biggest rush of relief when your little one arrives. I am going to keep you in my thoughts op and I hope you have a safe rest of your pregnancy and delivery goes smoothly for you."

Making it better? I've been on Humalog for the bulk of that time and my companies new insurance plan doesn't cover it. How the HELL does an insurance company NOT cover such a common prescription drug to manage this disease. As soon as I found out it was BCBS, I said to my self, ""...self, let's see where they try to fugg us..."" and, sure enough. 

Dexcom G6 equipment? Fully covered, no out-of-pocket cost. Insulin? ""Nay, try something different.""

Need to vent,"Just had a decent few weeks with my sugar, now back to normal bs… dosed for my breakfast. After an hour I spiked up to 290.. took 3 units.

Another half hour, back up to 270.. 2 more units.. half hour later. 253 again.. and another half hour later. 271 now. So time for another 2 units?? Usually I’m so sensitive after breakfast that when i spike, I’ll take 2 units and 45 minutes later ill go from 280 to 130. Now 7 units in total and it hasn’t budged??

Your insulin will need a while to correct the sugar, avoid overcorrecting (""rage bolusing""). 

Maybe a little walk or a bit sport can help to bring it down.

Don't stress yourself, it won't help. I made the experience the more I observe my levels in those situations the longer the insulin needs to do its job"

I highly recommend doing this, especially if you want to get the best control."

If you do use it though, I think the metal infusion sets are the best for reduction of of infection. 

There are only two downsides, #1 is that it can hurt, but you can use numbing cream (lidocaine) to help, and #2 certain sites will leave bruises or other bad stuff. Since my mom is kind of a 'hippie' with traditional medicine, she has a healing salve, and it works SO well. I'll occasionally get bruises, but it's quite rare. So yes, I'd recommend a pump. It's most likely gotten better in the last 15 years.

I don't have a g7, I'm still on the g6, and it works alright. Certain sensors and codes are bad, and honestly it can be a real chore to deal with it sometimes, but I think I've gotten used to it now"

Me and my dad were out practicing baseball for fun, when all of sudden, out on the field, I just felt at a complete loss of energy. I wasn't hungry, I just felt weak. I think that was my unstable blood sugars due to DKA

If you manage your diabetes well, or really even just attempt to, it is rather difficult to get into DKA. Having high sugars do not mean DKA, lack of insulin does. You can run high sugars consistently and never get into DKA if you continue to use insulin. There’s been times where I’ve ran high persistently for days straight. My insulin sensitivity was awful and my sugar never wanted to drop, however I never got into DKA because I continued to take insulin."

Also, have you ever heard of TMS? It can be expensive and insurance doesn’t always want to cover it, but it’s worth looking into if you’re able to do it. I’m currently in treatment and it’s made a huge difference, especially when medications just don’t work as well.

Overwhelmed but committed,"First off thank you to any help, I apologize for the length. My brother (early 20s) moved in with me 12 months ago & is diabetic. Before being diagnosed as Type 1 he had a few brain surgeries to cut out carnivorous malformations, which also greatly affected his critical thinking/problem solving abilities. Despite both conditions he has been on his own since 16 & has had a rough go. I knew going in his blood sugar management couldn’t be the best.  

Since moving in I’ve found him 5-6x having seizures, we found it’s been due to mismanagement of his blood sugars not his other condition. Finally got him on a G7 Dexcom last week but really struggling with stopping the fluctuations everytime he eats. He’ll swing from 70-350 blood sugar frequently. From reading, it seems having blood go out of the 80-185 range for more than 15 minutes is an issue. I’ve come to discover he & I  know very little on blood sugar management. Currently working on cutting carbs out of his diet, having him take insulin 15-30 min. before he eats, and accurate carb counts. 

Please excuse my ignorance I’m learning everything on the job and it’s a bit overwhelming. 

Anyone have any advice/tips that have helped you or someone you take care of?

Then pre bolus for meals, that’s the 15-20 minutes before eating, using short acting.  Get a carb ratio and do the math counting carbs.  He doesn’t have to eliminate carbs though dialing back can be helpful.  Don’t stress being perfect."

BTW short term high blood sugars are common even with good management, lows you need to make sure to treat. Also, once your blood sugar is high it takes any correction insulin you add a while to drop it down. I get BS over 200 regularly without causing medical issues but with insulin it often will spike and drop."

Anything helps! Thank you",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14viyiy/overwhelmed_but_committed/,"Ooh, I'm very sorry to hear, I think I have some advice that may (?) help.

One is something called fat and protein bolus, which gives a few (1-4) extra carbs depending on how much fat and protein is in the food being consumed. Unfortunately I don't have the exact ratio of F&P to extra carbs, but it definitely helped me out overall.

Also, another thing would be physical exercise. Anytime I go to take a walk in the morning, even if it's just a .5 mile walk, it heavily affects my afternoon, and very often I'll just sit there doing nothing because my number won't come up above 110-130. And yeah, physical exercise helps against insulin resistance, making insulin more effective.

Another thing you could try is healthy eating. I know the doctors always say that ""just eat whatever and bolus for it"", that's nowhere near as complex as it really is. Eating healthier does make blood sugar management easier. Things like whole grain, wild/brown rice instead of white, and even vegetables and fruits really go a long way. Unfortunately, eating healthier tends to be more expensive, so it's not something I can guarantee.

Hope this helps"

All you need for set up is the individuals weight and goal range and in order to bolus for meals you just specify the type of meal (breakfast, lunch or dinner) if the meal is smaller than usual, same as usual, or more than usual - it requires NO carb counting.

I don’t know too too much about it but seems like a great tool to help make self sustained diabetes care more accessible to all individuals!

I've been on Afrezza for the past few months and it is incredibly fast acting. Definitely a newer medication I would recommend checking out. 

Over the past two years, I've seen a few crispr/stem cell treatment studies coming from the Salk Institute and Viacyte. If we can turn off the flags that trigger the immune response, that would be a much more exciting treatment. 

This link is still one of my favorites to read when I'm having a tough time with it. I am hoping to see something come of this in the next decade.

Sudden itching and tingling,"I’ve had sudden onset of itching all over body.

Then today I got out of shower and I’ve started getting tingling sensations all over my body. I’ve been t1d for 22 years now. A1c usually around 7. I’ve had a number of high blood sugars where I’ve been 300 for like 3-5 hours a day the last few weeks. I’m usually TIR around 70% of time. I see my dr regularly, he checks my feet for neuropathy every time, says sees no signs, just had a detailed eye exam and they said no signs of any diabetic damage.  Everything I’m reading on google says nerve damage caused by neuropathy, even seeing things about MS, I’m pretty nervous, anyone have any feedback?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14vcmjv/sudden_itching_and_tingling/,Did they check your liver enzymes?

After the pandemic, when we both had jobs, I called to get them off the roles and they actually kinda begged us to stay on. Didn’t care that we were making pretty good $$ again. I was tempted to stay on but my husband felt like we were depriving others of resources, despite them telling us directly and repeatedly that was not the case. Highly recommend."

My son is on Medicaid and I spoke to his case manager last year she reclassified him to their Under 19 program and off of the COVID emergency program. I didn't think much about it (he is not diabetic but has similiar medical disability) until we were in the ER at our local children's hospital and were notified if he was COVID funded, we may have already lost his Medicaid coverage and had not been notified yet.  I don't want anyone to be responsible for a large hospital bill because that's what is happening to a lot of kids and their parents now."

I am the first in my family to develop diabetes (T1.5). Getting together with extended family-people ask lots of questions and observe what I do. They especially like watching my Dexcom graph after I eat something. I think the confusion happens because some diabetics restrict carbs and some do not.  For a non diabetic that can be hard to wrap your head around.   To split the difference between the 2 approaches, they play it safe and make a special teeny tiny cupcake just for you?  Awwww..

I understand, ti can cause tension or discomfort, I'm not one to speak to a supervisor lightly, it's like a big decision. But if it impacts your work or how you feel at work, maybe see what options you have to discuss with a higher up. Bring literature or send links if you have a meeting with HR or manager or whomever so they can understand the context of T1, and how what she is saying has nothing to do with T1 and commenting on your food has no place in the workplace. i would bring up the fact they don't comment on other peoples food (or do they)?

Somehow I can't convince my coworker that I don't need to be on a sugar-free diet. She always brings me really tiny treats and says don't go wild. 😆,,https://i.redd.it/5tsky27tuvab1.jpg,"I was diagnosed in 1990. The AIDS scare and the huge amount of blood needed to do a blood sugar (you had to completely cover a 1/4 inch square with a single drop) made doing anything a challenge away from home!!! In an era where people were concerned sitting on a toilet seat could give you AIDS (and it was still a death sentence with no effective treatment), you were shunned for that much blood. I was only allowed to test in the nurses office (which only had cold water in the sink - so much fun to get that much blood after washing in an ice bath in winter) and no insulin was allowed on school grounds. When I went into high school and switched to taking more than 2 shots a day, we didn't tell the school anything (they in theory knew I was diabetic but had no instructions for my care) and I carried my meter and insulin in my backpack. If they caught me with insulin I could have been expelled (zero tolerance included prescription medications), but I spent 1/2 my day at the community College and 1/2 at the high school Junior and Senior years, so it's not like I could have it locked up in the office and only accessible if a nurse was on duty. Luckily, I was capable of managing my own care from the time of diagnosis (12 years old) because I can't imagine surviving my school years if I were younger.

My brother was diagnosed at 3.5 years old, about a decade later. Even with a 504 plan that was a mess, and my mom was a teacher at the same school (she taught 7th grade until he reached 7th grade - then switched to 5th)! Teachers would yell at him for drinking chocolate milk, he was sent to the office for eating candy when making gingerbread houses in class (my mom sent the candy and knew he would eat it - just like all the other kids), and he had a health class where they taught that ALL diabetes was caused by poor life choices despite having an underweight 3rd grader (approximate - it may have been 2nd or 4th grade) who was T1 in class. Ignorance and misinformation are real challenges for T1s in so many circumstances! Learning to advocate for ourselves when necessary and to ignore other's stupidity the rest of the time is one of our superpowers."

My mom helped me with it so I learned and since I remember being a kid with diabetes and people doing this stupid crap I don't want history repeating itself. We live with it every single day and they don't so they need to stay out of our diabetes. I've had nurses that tried to treat me like a type 2 for the love of God! So I make sure to advocate for myself and I've taught my husband so he knows exactly what to do with these people.

She always brings me really tiny treats and says don't go wild. 😆,,https://i.redd.it/5tsky27tuvab1.jpg,"I was diagnosed in 1995 when I was 10 and my son was diagnosed at 9 in 2019 a week after his birthday. I find it interesting that he was basically the same age I was but we found out early because of the antibody test. I never had anyone say anything about AIDS to me but I remember those stupid meters that you had to have half a gallon of blood for. When I was in school there was no nurse but they kept my insulin in the counselors office and I would go in and take it before lunch. Luckily where I lived there were a TON of Karens so they didn't really argue with parents but they didn't want needles roaming the school so they kept them and I'd just go get into it. I was allowed to keep my meter and none of the teachers said anything but they were told to leave me alone about that and snacks. I got a pump in 1997, it took mom almost a year to get in 1997. 🙄 

Now that my son has to deal with this he has always had a 504 and they take it very seriously since it's federal law and they don't want to get sued if something happens to him plus the Karens. I just put everything I can in the 504. Everything I can think of that I needed in school. They do keep his pump supplies in the office because needles or if they have a nurse their office. He is in middle school now so I think we're going to sneak things in his book bag because having to go to the office is time consuming and annoying. So far we haven't had any issues with teachers saying anything but I try to speak to all of them and educate. It's nice when they've had a t1d prior but it's not common here. If he does ever have an issue and he can't handle it I'll be in the principals office arguing. I have found that most of the teachers think he is type 2 because they don't know any better but he's 5'8 and 118 pounds so he's super skinny but they still think that so I'll go into great detail to educate. My stubborn child has done pretty good with standing up for himself with adults and students because the students make fun of him and I hate that but the same thing happened to me and kids are mean. I got him a shirt that says I inject myself with stuff that would kill you be nice and he absolutely loves that shirt for the kids that pick on him. Do you have any type 1 kids?"

When he was diagnosed (we noticed right away when he drank an extra soda at lunch and had an accident while out - he was recently potty trained.

With mental issues like burnout, depression of course professional help is absolutely appropriate but not that easy to realize for everyone.

It’s also usually about the age where your average kid can take on more (if not most) responsibility for their own treatment and care. Of course this starts slowly and builds up as they do a good job with it.

All through middle school and high school, my blood sugars were insane. I played lots of sports which didn’t help the blood sugars. Often times during this phase of life, endos understand it’s difficult to control. Your doctor isn’t lying to make you feel better about his blood sugars. If she thought you needed to do better, she would tell you! Try and trust in that, and remind yourself that it’s normal to have out of whack blood sugars sometimes (especially at his age!). I really think the best thing you can do is make sure he’s beginning to take control of his management, the goal is to make sure he’s self-sufficient by adulthood so now is the time to teach him! This age also correlates with things like going out with friends more, sleepovers, more independence - so he will need to be able to manage his diabetes away from you likely in the near future.

It is going to get better! I was diagnosed at 15 and from the outset I pretty much handled my own care, for better and worse. Your son will be able to take on more and more responsibility for his own treatment as he matures. There are going to be some mis-steps along the way for sure, but it can be handled. 

In the meantime, remember that you've kept him healthy for all these years and give yourself a little grace. T1 is hard. Do the best you can and if you've done the best you can, sleep well at night. Don't be afraid to ask questions here. We're here to help."

The main thing you need to do is lower your standards of success. Im 27 and was diagnosed at age 3: my sugars still go extremely sporradic, often for no reason. Diabetes is a finnicky temperamental pain in the ass sometimes. You cant beat yourself up over it. 
As for financial burden: id do some looking online to see if there are any resources that might be able to help out with covering the cost for equipment, medications, and doctors. Good rx can certainly be a huge money saver if insurance doesnt want to cover anything. And with each new prescription, ask for a prior authorization to see if that can get insurance to cover more. 
And lastly: remember you are getting through the hardest time of a diabetic. Childhood and puberty both cause a lot of difficulties: its okay to not be able to stay on top of it the entire time. You just do what you can, roll with the punches, and keep going. 
Id recommend possibly seeing a therapist if you can, but im guessing thats probably not exactly accessible given how your insurance is treating diabetes. I know a year of therapy didnt wonders with me dealing with burnout just by teaching me its okay to fail. I still struggle with it, but its still helped a lot."

Things were done differently back in the olden days when we didn’t have the amazing tech we do now but in some ways it was easier. I would have just 2 injections a day but had to stick to a very strict regime of carbs at very set times of the day & things like sweets, cakes etc were definitely off the table! 

When I was diagnosed I wasn’t allowed to leave the hospital until I could prove I could do my own injections; not my parents but me at the age of 4. And tell the nurse how many carbs there were things like apples or a slice of bread. I was forced into having the learn about it at 4. Was it logical or realistic? No probably not but it’s how things were back in the 70s. 

Once I was home my Mum would draw my injections up for me & I would do them; she would also boil my needles & syringes because kids & boiling saucepans don’t make a happy combination normally!

As I got older I did more & more of it. And I’m grateful I did because when my Mum passed away from cancer when I was 13 I could at least be independent for my own diabetes; there was no way my Dad could have done anything, he just couldn’t deal with any of it bless him.

The point of my ramblings is this - you feel you are helping him & protecting him from having to deal with type 1; be a normal kid & not worry about it. But trust me - he’s still worries about it! And he can still be a normal kid doing everything his mates are doing! It just takes a little more planning & forethought which right now you are doing for him. He needs to learn to do it for himself if he’s ever going to be a fully independent type 1 adult. And he’ll be able to live as full a life as he chooses! I’ve done the 3 peaks challenge, run multiple marathons & ultras, sky dived, travelled all over, had 4 healthy now adult sons & a career. Diabetes has never ever stopped me doing anything. 

You are doing an amazing job Mama, if his endos are telling you this listen to them. But for your own sake & his give him some responsibility for his own type 1. You can help advise & guide but you’re not helping future him by doing it all for him now. What if something were to happen to you? Sorry to sound so blunt I don’t mean it to be but you need to start letting him help himself. You might be surprised & find he’s grateful for taking the burden off you! This condition is a bitch but there is nothing you have done to cause nor anything you could have done to prevent it; it’s not preventable or curable. Yes he’ll make mistakes; we all do! No matter how hard we try this condition can still surprise us by following its own rules. The key is not to jump on those mistakes but to learn from them. We learn from those mistakes which is why their important.

Sorry didn’t mean for this post to be so long! You & your son are doing a great job & will continue to do so I’m sure x"

I’ve just really gotten jaded about medical professionals TBH. Just because there might be a few people out there who have issues (there are many reasons why T1’s can end up DKA, from the initial diagnosis obviously, to those who’d walk with depression because of this disease, pump site failure, illness, stress, lack of access to insulin, and many other reasons) is absolutely no excuse for doctors and nurses to joke about DKA.

I’m always on subs trying to encourage advocacy and spreading knowledge about T1, but don’t know what to say anymore.

You're in a tough phase now, but you're not going to just go through withdrawal obviously, so once this is all routine bs order extra everything!! Insulin, needles, test kits and strips, etc. It is easy to just do whatever you want without anyone watching at all. Maybe it will take a lot for you to do that, but it'll completely relieve you of any stress in all of this.

I have a bad habit of just barfing more and more hoping DKA will just turn out to be high bs and go away though, I hate medical help of any kind that much and my entire mindset is definitely not one to follow closely for people who worry much and are in more delicate situations. However, I do manage my own type 1 and I am fine. I resent my doctor, my appts with him are basically 10min reruns of nothing at all, I keep up with him just because my family thinks he is the reason I'm alive.

BG won't come down.,"Hello, I'm new to the group.

I'm T1D (brittle) from birth, 47 years old.

I have been on Medtronic pumps for about ten years, currently I am on a Minimed 770G, I am also on a Guardian CGM.

Late last night I had a BG spike while taking a nap, was above 300 when I woke up.

Naturally, I bolused a correction and waited, an hour later it had not come down but had shot up to above 350.

Cut to 4 hours and two more boluses later and it was still not coming down.

I decided to give myself a 3 unit injection via syringe and it is finally coming down.

The only conclusion I  can surmise is that my pump wasn't delivering insulin yet gave me no warning along those lines.

Has anyone ever experienced this with Medtronic pumps where they stop delivering yet can't seem to detect it?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14uvrvu/bg_wont_come_down/,"Standard protocol I use:  
1.  Give correction & check after an hour for movement.   
2.  No movement or goes up?  Change insulin and inset.  Check if a bent cannula is the reason for bad results.   
3.  Give a new correction bolus that ignores IOB (insulin on board) factor.  
4.  Check one hour later for movement.  No movement or goesl up, repeat 3 & 4 a couple of times.  
5.  After 6-8 hours fighting a stubborn high, I have previously administered a small correction dose into muscle tissue.  This is a last resort, but usually works.  
As the other commentor said:  Drink copious amounts of water and monitor ketone levels.  
Good Luck."

Here’s what I do in a situation like that:

Pre-step: I recognize my blood sugar is high or way above my target range (more than 120 points past the highest  target reading). I double check with a finger prick and confirm. 

1) Give correction dose according to my pump settings. Wait 90 minutes 

2) Check blood sugar again via finger prick and see if it moved. 

2.1 If it moved down by at least 20 points, I am comfortable in knowing my pump and cannula are working and maybe it’s what i ate / didn’t bolus enough, or random bout of insulin resistance.

2.2 If it moved down by less than 20 points or is relatively the same, move to step 3.

2.3. If blood sugar is higher, move directly to step 4.

3) Give another correction dose with my pump settings, drink at least 6 oz of water and move around a bit (whether marching in place or walking around my house). Go back to steps 2.1-2.3 after 60 minutes this time after testing blood sugar via finger prick again.

4) In the event it’s still same or rising higher, take out the cannula, give a subcutaneous shot of fast acting insulin (amount varies depending on my BS level) and put in a new infusion set in a different location. If the cannula is bent then I assume it’s infusion set failure (unfortunately, minimed pumps sometimes can miss it). If it’s straight and I see some insulin coming out, I assume it was my site had too much scar tissue.

I’ve noticed on fatty/over used site areas on my stomach, my minimed pump wouldn’t alarm that insulin isn’t delivering. Maybe because it technically is going through but the scar tissue/fat isn’t absorbing it. If you been using a pump for a super long time (even if you rotate sites) , it can still make you prone to scaring and fatty deposits building up in certain locations on the body—especially if your genetically predisposed.

I hope everything is better now! My Endo and I developed this plan years ago when I was a teen and I still use it to this day. It helps me without fail every single time . Luckily, I only get site failures maybe once or twice a year and I tend to catch them early on before it gets too high."

I have been on Medtronic pumps for about ten years, currently I am on a Minimed 770G, I am also on a Guardian CGM.

Late last night I had a BG spike while taking a nap, was above 300 when I woke up.

Naturally, I bolused a correction and waited, an hour later it had not come down but had shot up to above 350.

Cut to 4 hours and two more boluses later and it was still not coming down.

Today I “guessed” myself out of DKA.,"Went to work 1 hour away from where I live. Forgot glucometer at home, also forgot to bolus for breakfast. What a fuckin’ combo, right?!

Well I get to work and a half hour later I feel muscle tension underneath my elbows, above my knee caps, and in my forearms. Including nausea. Something is up at this point. 
I give myself 8 units of fast acting insulin and one hour later I still feel sick. 

I have been type 1 all my life, I know what’s happening here. I now bolus 10 additional units. 
This story is anti-climatic, and I’m fucking glad it stayed that way. 

Over time I eventually felt better, then low, then corrected that low and snacked some, but became low again shortly after. 
Repeat/repeat, now at this point all my active insulin is used up (pump says 0 active insulin on board) and I feel okay. 

This all happened without a glucometer. 
I’m safe and sound now.

Best advice i ever got was ""Ignore your numbers when you're first diagnosed. Numbers will come and go. Focus on your habits, because those will last a life time. Your habits will determine your medical outcome."" That being said, your numbers are fantastic, for three months in. With an A1C of 6.1%, its obvious you are not just eating whatever you want. Of course you have a lot of questions at this point. Because its all new and overwhelming. Find a care team that respects you, and can help educate you. At this stage, you don't have enough experience to evaluate things you might research, so that's not good solution. I'm sorry you're being dismissed. T1D is hard enough without that.

You're doing great! My 15f was diagnosed in March with an a1c of 14+. When we went to the first follow up appt her a1c was 9ish.  And her endo (she's being seen at the best children's hospital in our city, and we live near a major one, so I assume she knows what she's talking about.) Was super happy with that. And said we should be aiming 7 or less. So you're doing really really good! And with type 1, you can have anything you want you just have to dose with insulin for it. With type 2, changing your diet and exercise and sometimes medication is needed. But with type 1 you need to give yourself insulin, no matter what you do or don't eat, your body doesn't (or since you're newly diagnosed you may still but eventually will not) produce any insulin. Restricting foods won't make any difference for you like it would for a type 2 diabetic. I'm so sorry you're not getting any support from your Dr, but you are doing really great so far!"

Edit to say that I missed that last part of your post. That’s weird as hell. “And now he’s got leverage over you,” is what my paranoid brain is saying. Those are some serious alarm bells. I know country life is tight-knit, but this goes beyond that. He might feel entitled to do or not do whatever the hell he wants, because his service is free. 

Even giving him benefit of the doubt and assuming he started out with good intentions, like a favor-to-a-friend type stuff, that still gives him a _lot_ of control over you and your situation, and he’s already in a position of authority. 

Drop that guy, if you can. If you can’t, maybe insist on paying him, and make sure it’s documented somewhere."

Like, I’m surprised fucking nasa isn’t involved in this shit. When I’m on a training break, my A1C goes back up to 6.4-ish.. normal range is like 5-7, and even when I’m on break and a tad higher, I’m still beating all my non-diabetic and type 2 friends. 

It has been my experience that any doctor that dismisses your questions and concerns - especially when it comes to something like type 1 diabetes - it’s time for a new doctor immediately. How has he not given you any direction in what you can/can’t have?! And the attitude that you have to figure this out on your own is straight fucked. No, you don’t. And you shouldn’t. The learning curve with this crap isn’t big and you can end up seriously sick or dead with even small fuck ups.

There's much more too. 

Even if you had a great endo you will need to become your own nurse. As time goes on you will realize you know your body and your patterns much better than your doctor. Your confidence in your self care is a diabetics greatest tool. You are doing a great thing by reaching out.

My best advice here though is fuck that endo. That is absolutely awful, I REALLY encourage you to find a new endo, im assuming they started you off with an adult endo so you could avoid that transition but I highly recommend you find a new one. 6.1 A1C is what I was at my most recent appt in April. 6.1 is also absolutely fabulous, ESPECIALLY since you were just diagnosed so great job dude!!! My A1C stayed in the 7's for YEARS, like I'm talking from probably a year or so post diagnosis til probably a year or so ago, I've stayed in the 6's since then. A1C in the 6's 3 months post diagnosis is astonishing. The electricity feeling in your legs could just be temporary nerve damage from you having gone into DKA but could also potentially be neuropathy, which you really would need to get that checked out ASAP. A normal endo would not tell you to do your own research or that your A1C is bad so your first steps will have to be finding a new endo, I wish I could help you there but I unfortunately have absolutely zero education on that because I've gone through a children's hospital for mine.

I had nerve issues following my DKA. I tried physical therapy, over the counter treatments and prescriptions from my primary doctor but they didn't work.

Diabetes care varies a lot throughout the world. Many countries still use the older insulin, 2 shot a day, fixed meal regimen (was common everywhere until the mid to late 1990 - I was diagnosed in 1990) while care standards in most of the world include more shots per day with better insulins, using a carb/food ratio and a correction factor. Under the first plan, your diet is essential in regulating blood sugars, and meals must be both nutritionally similar and at the same time each day. Standard care in most of the world includes counting your carbs and changing your insulin dose at every meal. This gives you the freedom to eat what you want when you want (within reason - some things are still really hard to properly give insulin for). Many doctors recommend a restrictive diet when first diagnosed (easier to learn on similar meals of modest carbs), but eventually, there is no reason life needs to be that limited.

I agree with everyone here that your endo is not right for you. They need to be willing to answer your questions and should never tell you to go figure things out on your own, at least not without giving you access to education and training to help you do so. I'm not sure where in Europe you will be living, but hopefully, you can qualify for better care and get a good endo there.

An A1c of 6.1 is great. I hope you are not attaining this by having too many lows. They can be as damaging as highs if you go too low. Target for a T1 is 6.5 most of the time, though you can do better with really tight control. It is typically not worth the increased risk of hypoglycemia for most. My A1c ranges from 5.8-6.3 with T1 for 32+ years. My priority is avoiding all lows, especially as I have other health issues that complicate being low, rather than chasing the lowest possible A1c."

My advice, if you haven’t done so already, start journaling everything you eat and what you do for your diabetes care every day and what effects what.  If you do this for maybe 6 months you will learn so much about yourself and how your body works and you’ll learn what to do without much thought.

It will get better.

1st.  Know now that Type 1 is not your fault, and crush anyone that tries to say otherwise...including family. No clean eating or bs herb would have stopped what came. There is no cure. 

2nd.  Focus on keeping your BG under control.  Sounds like you're already doing it based on your phenomenal A1C.

3rd. In addition to this Redfit,there are great t1d pages on FB.  Because of your age, look at the t1d transitioning to college.  It will have largely parents in there, but information is power.  If you get a particular CGM...continuous glucose monitor, look for a FB page specific to that....same for pump if you get one.  

4th.  If you work, getvwith your HR to have FMLA in place to protect you. If in college, get with your counselor about establishing a 504 plan.  These are laws in place to help protect you from systemic or discriminatory processes.  

5th.  Lower carb diets will help you manage your bg.  Beware of Keto foods that are not necessarily low carb.  For the interim, Total Carbohydrates listed on food packaging is what you dose for.

6th. Calorie King app.  This will help in figuring carbs.  

Life will go on.  My now 14 year old was dx at 12.  I was dx a year ago at 46.  We do everything now.  She plays competitive volleyball, soccer, boxing, and is learning how to ride a dirtbike.

a1c of 6.1 is literslly perfect. your endo sucks find a new one don't waste ur money with them. you can eat whatever you want the hardest part is figuring out timing and ratio. if you can get a pump It'll bring the workload down by about 70% (diabetic since 2001, was like 6 years old  only in my family until like 15 years  later when everyone else started getting it) its best to be careful now with foods while figuring out the ratios, but once you know which foods need which carbs and the timing eat whatever the fuck you want. (my a1cs been around 5 as long as I can remember and I dont do special diets) everyone's different so it'll be a lot of experimenting, its easier with a pump cause it saves info but if u don't have a pump then jsut get a note book and try to write everything down (should take more than a few weeks if ur consistent)

you want to mark time, blood sugar, what u ate, amount of insulin and when u did insulin (I usually do 15 minutes before eating so when I start cooking) u don't need to do this all the time like sometimes we get hungry and don't want to wiat, don't punsih ur self diabetes is punishment enough 

certain types of food need insulin before eating, some right as u eat, others take forever to affect blood sugar (which if u did the insulin 15 minutes prior means ull be low and ends up being a train wreck) for me foods that take a while are the super starchy carb heavy stuff

getting the right znoutn of insulin is way easier with a pump cause you can do .1 or .2  .3 .4 ect, syringe aren't as exact but are manageable

incase u haven't had a lot of experience with lows... always keep somehting with u my fav and the most efficient is the dex tablets but any juice or snacks u like will work


sorry rambling

figure out carb/insulin ratio first
then live life don't let it control everything u don't need a special diet
your body lost the ability to create insulin, so now u are manually doing the work. it's like telling someone with a manual car they can't drive up a hill... they can but if they stop on that hill its going to be terrifying getting back into 1st gear the first few times but eventually it becomes 2nd nature 

there are a lot of foods that won't effect bloodsugar at least for me meats cheeses and a lot of veggies I don't do insulin with 

also congrats on the a1c! thats seriously really great!"

Agree that your endo is misguided. Glycemic variability and time in range % are much better indicators of overall health."

From what ive seen this is a great community, but the fact you have to turn to the internet to answer questions you are probably paying out the ass to see a specialist for is absolutely rediculous. I understand he cant take you through a ton of things in great detail in one visit.

You need to understand that this isn't your fault. You have questions because you care and are trying to be good to yourself. That will show in the long run. If you are presented with people who close you down, they may be good clinically but that isn't all you need help with so just move on because they aren't right for you at this point - especially if you are spending good money on them! You are doing things the right way, make small changes slowly and they will add up to great outcomes. 6.1 is a great number and I guess that has come with a lot of sacrifices. Over time you will learn how your body reacts to things so you won't need to sacrifice so much. It does get easier as you learn.

Since your doctor might not have told you: if you have too high blood sugar so you have some ketones, it can be dangerous to exercise. The body produce ketones during exercise to use fat as fuel(burning fat) and if you already have some ketones you run the risk of DKA."

Thankfully I have a decent endo that tells me to let my son be a kid. I had gestational diabetes and it was hard as hell. I was only allowed 15g of carbs per snack and 30g per meal. It was so so hard. Once I had the baby I crashed and I’ve spent 20 months binge eating all the carbs because I was so restricted. 

I honestly don’t know how to figure out carb ratios for you. I think you can find a chart online. My sons pump now has new ratios for every 2 hours lol so it’s tough. The pump we started with 1 unit for 35g and worked it out so now it’s a much smaller amount. I’m glad I didn’t have to do the math myself. 

I can understand you wanted to be a normal person. My son gets so angry sometimes and upset that he’s “not normal” or that he has to have a pump on him at all times etc it’s so heartbreaking. 

I also understand the panic attacks. I’m telling you I have no idea how I didn’t spiral into severe anxiety attacks after this kids diagnosis. I cried a lot during the first year. Some days I still do. (Been just over a year). There’s many negative emotions with the diagnosis. I’m mad. Blinding rage. Bitter resentment that it’s my baby and not someone else’s (I don’t wish this on anyone)…it’s a lot.

The tortillas are also deceptively high (I get bowls, so I can’t remember what I dosed for them). 

Extended bolus/split bolus can really help with this."

I do part of the dose 20 min before, part when I start eating, part when I stop, and part like an hour after. It’s a weird thing that works for me. I can do ramen or pizza and stay in between 80 and 150. You can try breaking it into smaller doses. Also if you are constantly high after, you are definitely underestimating the amount you need, so start raising the amount by a good chunk next time. And if you do underestimate, just drink water and go for a walk to bring you down more quickly after."

Keep in mind that the tortilla ALONE has \~45gs of carbs. For me, that's about the FULL amount of carbs I'll have in any single meal.

Add the rice (white rice: \~54gs of carb PER CUP (how many cups *do* they smash into their burritos?)) and the beans, and you're lookin' at >110gs of carbs in a burrito.

Me? I have a salad base, meat or chicken, smallish portion of black beans and veggies, avocado and sour cream. It's a FULL and tasty meal at a FRACTION of the carbs.

about to hit my 3 year anniversary,"got diagnosed during 2020 and have a sister that’s been diabetic for 13 yrs & im a terrible diabetic. i’m not really sure i have even fully processed it but trying to take it day by day. i also don’t eat real meals or anything && finding that motivation is so damn hard :/ after being diabetic for 3 years it’s a continuous heartbreak and stressor. id thought that i would have it down by now but no :/ i would love advice for a good meal plan that’s easy for someone who can’t cook LOL but also just wanted to talk! i hate this disease so much and finding comfort is so tough… also a big one big question is that does anyone struggle with dissociation problems ever since they’ve been diagnosed? 
thank u :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14utwls/about_to_hit_my_3_year_anniversary/,"Can’t help with the meal plans but honestly any low carb meals are great, I’m only one year in so should definitely be taking advice rather then giving it at this point haha. I always figure there worsts diseases to have out there you know at least this is somewhat manageable as awful as it is, and at the end of the day everyone’s got there worries and health problems. At least we have an excuse to take sweets with us every where we go.

Still have yet to meet another diabetic in real life besides a small dog, so feel yah on the support side of things haha but this page is great"

Diabetes is a difficult illness - it requires a ton of monitoring, lifestyle adjustments, and even then it’s never perfect. I would strongly recommend therapy if that is financially an option.

As far as meals, I find that predictable meals are the best. So what types of things do you already eat pretty often? Those are the things I would start with. If you eat turkey sandwiches a lot, then calculate your carbs and see what happens. If you go high, take more insulin next time and vice versa. I happen to eat fairly healthy, lots of fish, fruits, and veggies - but I don’t subscribe to the idea that you have to completely go low carb to manage diabetes. I also enjoy burgers, pizza, and brownies. Over the years, I know roughly how much insulin to take for those things, but it was trial and error.

Try to approach it like a science experiment. If it didn’t work last time, then try something new. And remember this isn’t your fault, diabetes is hard and we’re all doing the best we can. Take it one step at a time, only focus on one thing at a time. And eventually you’ll be a lot closer to “controlled”. You don’t have to figure it out all at once."

Do magnets affect meters and test strips?,"This could be such a dumb question, but I’m hoping someone on here knows. Would there be any issues if I keep magnetic things in my purse next to my glucose meter and test strips? For example, my iPad case holds closed magnetically.

I hope you feel the sacrifices you and your family made to undergo the studies were worth helping other diabetics get where they are today.

Did having your siblings also experiencing diabetes help combat the negative feelings you had about it growing up? I didn't know any other type 1's until I was 12, and my older cousin was diagnosed. I finally had someone I could relate to a little, but it was different growing up with it vs. getting it as a teenager. 

Congratulations on kicking cancer to the curb!! Hopefully, after the second time, it learned to stay away for good 😅 but I definitely make life decisions around my diabetes. How close am I to doctors, pharmacies, the nearest hospital? When considering career changes, insurance is always front and center in my decision-making. I've never wanted to carry my own children, which is great, because the thought of being pregnant and diabetic terrifies me. It's not that I can't live without considering these things, I just worry about the effect it would have on me emotionally, physically, and long term pretty much anytime I'm confronted with them.

I hope you recover quickly from covid (having it legitimately made me worry I wasn't going to make, and I'd rather have kidney stones again than deal with that) so you can get back to doing the work that matters to you, and the people around you!

You sound like a kick-ass person all around!!"

I'm glad each generation has diabetic management tech more advanced than the previous generation, but it makes me wonder what tech will be hard for new diabetics to believe we used daily.

Just feeling done, and weak.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14uajg5/going_through_a_lot/,"Hi Frank, I understand how you are feeling. I have been T1 for 32 years and have a ton of other health issues. I was sent home from the hospital in December 2014 with them telling my parents I was going home to die. Every day was a struggle, just waking up, knowing that pain was the only thing I had to look forward to. I had been disabled for a couple of years by then, so had Medicare and Medicaid, but couldn't get the help I needed (CGMs were not covered and I had been trying to get an insulin pump for years). I was ready to give up. I decided that I wanted a future, so I set my sights on going back to school. I spent a year working on improving my health (I couldn't even crawl to the bathroom and was living on the second floor of my parents split entry home, with 15 stairs between me and the outside world). Somehow, my determination got me through (and actually getting help from doctors now that the hospital confirmed the things I had been asking for help with for years and was just ignored), and by January 2016, I showed up at the local university to start the process of going back. It was the last day to apply for State financial aid (a grant program that covered all my tuition) for the upcoming fall, and I took that as a sign it was time! I continued to fight and struggle the whole time I was going through school (7 years), as my health continued falling apart, but kept going, overcoming massive hurdles to continue pursuing my goal. I finally graduated in May and am now looking for work in my chosen field. 

I know that my struggles have made me a stronger person and that I can accomplish anything I set my mind to. Every day is a new opportunity to move 1 step closer to your goal. In life, we have 2 options... give up or keep moving forward. There will always be days where you just need to pull your covers over your head and give in, but the more steps you can take towards your goal, the easier it becomes to overcome adversity.  It takes a strong will and determination to get through the types of challenges you have gone through in your life and to continue going forward. You have what it takes to reach your goal.

At my recent graduation, my school gave an award to one outstanding student. I was nominated, but the gentleman that won had overcome 15 years of homelessness to graduate and was planning to work in social services/corrections to help homeless children. Our past experiences make us strong advocates for others like us. My degree is in computer science, and my goal is to work to make better medical technology and help give people better access to medical technology. Without my cgm and insulin pump, I would not have lived to see graduation (hypoglycemic unaware, severe gastroparesis causing uncertainty in when/if food will digest, chronic pain spiking sugars randomly, etc), so this is how I want to give back. 

I understand what it's like to feel alone. Luckily, I have my family, who have kept me from homelessness, but even when surrounded by others, circumstances can make you feel isolated. No one understands what you are going through, and most won't even bother to try. Over the years, I have lost touch with all my friends, and although I interacted with others through school, we had nothing in common. 

My best advice to you is to refine your goals. Decide exactly what you want to do when you finish school, and use that goal to help propel you forward. Take advantage of all financial assistance available to you. Make sure to deal with your disability services office at school (it can be called many things, but every college has one) to put accommodations in place for diabetes and other challenges you face (they can let you reschedule an exam if your blood sugar is horribly high or low, give extra time for homework if you need, allow you to have your cgm out during exams, etc depending on your medical needs). Know that, once you have your degree, all your history can basically be erased. I had an 11 year career gap due to medical issues and going back to school, so nothing before college exists on my resume. Yes, I may have to explain what I did before in an interview (I am 45, not 25), but I can frame it about overcoming challenges and how I'm stronger for it, rather than just, ""I was sick"".

Each of us walks a unique path in life. It is unfortunate that many of us face so many challenges while others seem to have it easier, but everyone overcomes adversity and must climb their own personal mountains. I am sorry that you are struggling so much right now. Know that your ability to make it this far only proves you can get through this. Let your goals take shape and imagine your future. Let this be the light at the end of your tunnel and the reason why you push through your barriers."

It's just that soul-crushingly lonely feeling you have, one of like ""why do even try anything?"" 

But just know that life always operates in seasons. It's not always going to be the best and most fun thing ever. A lot of times it'll seem like there's no exit, like you're trapped in time.

But all you can do is just wait, and hope for something better. And even if you don't feel it (like when I was telling myself that a few days ago, I just couldn't see it at all), one day you will. Keep going strong, I'm sure that there will always be someone who'll have your back, even if it's a complete stranger"

A lot depends on age at diagnosis (younger people have shorter honeymoons in general) and how quickly you were diagnosed once symptoms started (if diagnosed in DKA honeymoon tends to be shorter due than those diagnosed while their symptoms were minimal). I was diagnosed at 12, only 1 week into having symptoms of excessive thirst and urination, and I had a 1 year cyclical honeymoon (1 month on ""normal"" insulin doses, 1 month off for 12 months). This is rare, but it can occur (I was the subject of a research study in 1991 when it happened). The honeymoon period can be a pain, but it gives you a chance to learn to deal with diabetes while having 'training wheels'. Your body can help respond to both highs and lows better than it will once the honeymoon ends, but it makes life unpredictable. As a T1, you are guaranteed your honeymoon will end at some point, but there are people whose honeymoons have lasted more than a decade (T1.5 - LADA, slow onset T1). It's hard to know where you will fall. If your sugars start climbing and you need to increase your insulin significantly over a few days, the honeymoon is likely over (or you are sick, stressed out, etc)."

Tips on meal spikes,Hey any one got any tips on how to not spike after meals? I pre-bolus and am trying to eat oats and pasta for breakfast/lunch but still spikes. Even worse when I’m in work and it usually spikes then later on it’ll drop because I’m moving around a lot more. Really annoying me at the moment.,https://i.redd.it/s2y0ky7s8tab1.jpg,"My main advice is to keep a little food journal. Write down when you eat and when the food hits, as well as when you bolus and when the insulin peaks- if you are peaking and then dropping, it usually means your insulin is hitting the hardest AFTER your body processes the food, so you might want to wait 15/20 mins after you bolus before you eat, see if that helps at all!"

if you were to repeat your depicted day exactly as far as food and activity goes, i would suggest prebolusing even earlier, as suggested above"

As an aside, as I’m falling quite into middle age, I can honestly say this is a question that comes to my mind often-if I end up in a senior home or care facility one day, I don’t know how I’d manage if someone took away my pump or my self care whether or not I had my mental faculty: I’m working on how to plan for this eventuality and I don’t want the route of someone who doesn’t know (medical staff I mean you) the difference between T1 and T2 (Kept at high levels and insulin given on some medieval sliding scale which makes your health fail).

 If I have my mental faculties and the ability to keep my pump, or even cgm plus injections but I was managing that on my own, then I’m fine with that. Im not fine with any other option. 

Your post has brought up a good question for all T1’s who will get to be seniors one day. This is why a advocacy is so important-advocate for those who cannot. Please keep us posted and use whatever resources you can get to help her stay safe and pumped."

 Dexcom customer support only does 3 free sensor replacements every quarter (viz. 1 per month) AFAIK and insurance won’t cover more than 3 per month. I find myself needing 6 sensors on average per month but paying for it out of pocket is hard every month...

Do other folks here have this problem too? What can I do about it?",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/14u0o6n,"I have been using G6 for about 2 years and had only a handful of failures including one serious bleeder during insertion. Dexcom immediately replaced every one since there were so few; I didn't know they had a replacement limit! Is that a written rule of theirs or just a tech support person? Have you asked for supervisor assistance? I had to do that once to replace a transmitter early when hospital staff removed and lost it during an MRI. Readings and connection get pretty squirrelly in days 8-10 but only had to replace a few. I'm also not overly active and very careful to protect both my devices. Sounds like the kiddo might be very rough on them! Maybe your endo can increase the quantity per Rx, but insurance seems to control doctors as well? I get extra Omnipods because my endo specified 48 hours per device so I get 45/quarter instead of 30. I've never changed one early but I appreciate the copay savings!"

It shifts the osmolarity.  Thus you become dehydrated. 

This impacts your brain, the lenses in your eyes, etc. Rapid drops mean a change in osmolarity without giving the physiology a chance to adjust to it.  

So hydrate with water and electrolytes."

They will say you have to meet certain requirements but once you reach those they will change things or just flat out deny it as “medically unnecessary.”

As someone else mentioned, you might be able to appeal to get your insurance to cover a CGM. But even if you have to pay out of pocket until you get better insurance, it’s worth it."

Get comfy with checking BG often, whether sticks or CGM, work it into your daily routine 4+ times for your own safety and education at this point. 
I’d recommend Dexcom when you get to that point, like others here, that’s what I use and it’s reliable though not perfect. I use that with the Omnipod and they work well without being too uncomfortable. 
I did finger pricks and pens for the first 8 years though, like many of us here. It sucks, but hey, diabetes sucks and the tech just gets better over time. As for insurance, pick a plan next year knowing what you’re looking for. That’s when you’ll actually be able to start using it.

That said, yes, definitely appeal and push your insurance to cover it. It makes NO sense to make people wait 6 months."

The doctor just didn’t want to learn about afrezza, also didn’t like that the patient did a bunch of research/talked with others who have used the drug successfully & implemented the wisdom to great benefit. Seems to be a lot of “because I said so!” & “because this is the way we’ve been doing it!” instead of partnering with patients to reach most optimal outcome.

If you don't eat, the body starts burning fat for energy and that increases the blood sugar.  It's usually a nice slow increase like the one you're seeing but it's also a pretty sustained increase that requires a fair correction.  

If you skip a lot of meals, you'll figure out how much your body produces each time and get a better feel for how much to correct and when to correct.  Generally best to wait until the increase starts and you get that hungry feeling so you don't correct when (for whatever reason) your body decides NOT to burn fat that one time.  It would be analogous to knowing you ate an XYZ to for energy and correcting for that only you have to wait until the CGM shows you the increase rather than taking it when you eat.  That means you're always going to run a bit behind on the correction and your control suffers a bit."

Need honest answer about roller coasting BG,"Hi there. I've been a T1D for over 10 years, never have I had a great steady BG. Always going up and down at all times.

I’d encourage you to work with your CDCES to dial in your basal, I:C, ISF. Sounds like one way or another you’re getting too much and too little insulin. I have some resources I can share if you’d like to read more about basal strategies on your own.

I'm in better health than some folks my age due to being t1d.

The swings you describe and extended times either high or low will cause issues. Being low repeatedly will accelerate the onset of dangerous hypoglycemia unawareness. Being high will contribute to development of arterial disease. Both of these will be consequences as you age if you continue this path.

The most important decision about avoiding the roller coaster is about food. Refined, processed, rich \[non\] foods result in highs. The insulin to combat this may lead to lows followed by ingesting empty calories...

Most of my meals and snacks are prepared at home to avoid the food FOG (fat, oil, grease). ""Be in control and prepare your own foods so you can eliminate unknown excess fat, oil, grease (FOG) and sugar -- reduce these by at least 50% to 75% in any recipe. Avoid all fried foods and choose grilled instead. Stay heart healthy, follow a plant based diet and reduce or eliminate meat. Poultry and fish should be grilled (not fried).  A good reference for learning is The CalorieKing Calorie Fat & Carbohydrate Counter.""

The notion that we can eat anything, in my view, is false if you seek long term success. Success requires discipline and balancing insulin, food, and remaining physical active -- the latter should be almost daily e.g., hike, bike, tennis...

My last 6.5 year average A1c is 5.6 (range 5.4-5.9) without hypoglycemia. And I do eat all natural ice cream, home made pizza, pies etc., so it's not avoiding foods it's about choosing  what to eat, when to eat and how much.

I'm doing better recently, at a 6.3 A1c, and have narrowed the gaps pretty significantly, but I just want to honest truth from someone, not vague answers.

Hoping for some quick advice,My sons sugar has been high for most of the evening. It’s 130am and he was at 19 and rising about 40 minutes ago. I gave a small correction (tslim x2) then and now he’s 18 angled arrow up. Should I swap the site out? He did bang his arm a few hours ago and complained the pump hurt his arm when he did so. He had cake about 3 hours ago (he was up late and it was my moms birthday cake).

In case others have tips and want to convert. He is 300+ so workable but high and arrow up.

That said, I usually feel for wetness at the site to see if it's not going. Check against a fingerstick - the drop combined with an up arrow may be a result of a Dexcom delay. Also remember that being high for a while makes someone insulin resistant. Combine that with cake and I could see a big bolus being necessary, but you know his responsiveness more than anybody."

Yes people use (the same) insulin from 2 vials. There are articles about not doing that but that is typically about hospitals and not reusing vials for different people. Officially I would ask your med team but insulin is not cheap or easy to have lots of."

Life long complications are not coming from one night, what you did was avoid a trip to ER by paying attention and changing the site. You can check for any lows the next 1.5 hrs (the peak) and by 4hrs depending on the insulin, it will have tailed off and you can carb, correct with more insulin or leave it be based on the BG (and sleep well).

He was diagnosed just over a year ago. But now the pump is fairly new so I feel like I don’t have any idea what I’m doing again. So far everything’s been mainly good. I did have one needle bend when I put the infusion set on so had to change the whole thing. And another time I forget specifically why I decided to change it. I think he was a bit too high for a bit too long. And I could see that it had bent inside of his body. When I took it off it was a weird white colour in one spot and super flimsy. That’s been all so far. Then this one where he must have yanked it a bit when he banged his arm. I’m just so glad I haven’t landed him in the hospital LOL. I speak with this one woman who lives nearby. Twice now her 7 year old has landed in the hospital in dka because of a bent cannula. And she’s only been on the pump since March or April. So I was really scared going into this. She uses the same pump as well. I watched the videos (insertion, filling everything, all the videos I could) about 100x each before I even did the training classes. When I finally went to put it on him the first time…I felt like it was something I had done for years. Haha. So that was a huge win for me! But I always second guess myself. I was sure I should change it today. But I waited 45 minutes after I decided I thought it needed changed. And posted here first. It’s like…I feel like I need someone who’s more advanced to tell me I’m doing the right thing so I don’t feel stupid or something. I’m not sure how to explain it."

How do I know if it’s working? The reason I ask is because now he’s coming down, while I was swapping out the site. So I didn’t give anymore insulin.

Watching Steel Magnolias made me feel so bad about myself,So I saw Steel Magnolias for the first time recently and I’m so confused. Why was everyone acting like Julia robert’s character had a terminal illness? They never explain what was wrong with her other than the fact that she is diabetic. Diabetics have children all the time. Why would a baby kill me? Clearly she had a other issue (from not managing her blood sugars well?) also there’s a scene where she has low blood sugar and literally goes insane and refuses orange juice. I have never once refused sugar when I was low because I don’t want to die. I just hate how they make it seem like anyone with this illness is fragile and write it off as a death sentence,https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14s4jfl/watching_steel_magnolias_made_me_feel_so_bad/,"1989 (when the movie came out) or 1987 (when the play was written) was such a completely different era in terms of medicine it's hard to describe if you weren't there. Engineered human insulin (Humulin) had just come out, a lot of insulin was still ""humanized' pig insulin. Glucose measurement and control was very inexact. Women were routinely advised not to get pregnant. I received my first kidney transplant around that time and it was \*brutal\*

So yeah, for the time, it's sadly accurate. We have come a long way with treatments even though we still have so far to go."

While you don’t refuse sugar, I had a friend when I was in my late teens to early 20s that would become extremely combative and angry when he was low. 

Also, that movie is from 1989.  A lot has changed on the diabetes world since then.  One of my parents friends is diabetic and was told not to have kids because diabetes.  She got pregnant and the pregnancy was rough."

This was my first meter.

Diabetes management was very different then. No pumps (at least where I live) and no CGM. No basal/bolus regimen. Insulin twice a day that you had to feed (you were put on a strict diet that mandated a certain number of carbs at allotted times of the day - too bad if you weren't hungry or were ravenous). No sleeping in ever. No sweets (of course we found ways around this). We wrote our test result in a little book that had space for four results per day (a lot of the time we cheated and made up the results).

It was a very difficult way to live and we had none of the freedom we have today. Even sticking to everything that was asked of us resulted in terrible glucose levels. It was restrictive and we rebelled.

Now I eat what I want, when I want, and get great results. Advances in diabetes technology has made it much easier to live with type 1. It still sucks but people who are diagnosed now have no idea of what it was like.

EDIT: I feel very lucky that meters were available when I was diagnosed and I didn't have to rely on urine testing. Maybe someday people will look back and say ""Oh my god, when I was diagnosed I had to be attached to a pump all day and wear a chunk of plastic in my arm to read my glucose levels. You would not believe the constant beeping."""

Many people do become combative with extreme lows - or likely she had hypo unawareness.

Op, it is not long ago type one was a death sentence. At the time of that movie, home blood sugar testing it was barely a thing. Winging it was the way.

I was a T1 teen when the movie came out though I didn't see the movie until much later in life.  The portrayal is very fair and what happened to her is also very possible, especially back then.  And some people to become combative when low, I have witnessed and dealt with it many times throughout my life.  It is not the fault of the patient.  Monitoring levels was a much bigger ordeal in the 80's, and that method was a vast improvement over the years prior.  T1 wasn't even survivable throughout almost all of human history, it was literally a death sentence.  And this is a bit off topic, but having a baby can actually kill you and it does kill many women, especially those without access to health care, or access to good health care.

My friend had a dear friend who died in the early 90's from complications of T1.  The deceased didn't see her 21st birthday and was blind, with kidney failure.  Some people have bodies that handle having T1 much better than others and some people, much worse.  If the poor girl was raised now, she would likely been able to live much longer and happier, with the help of modern tech.  I look back at the years before modern tech and wonder how much better my poor body would be if I had a Dexcom when I was a teenager.  I'm just happy to have one now.  

I understand how angry you felt watching that character, I was as well, even those many years ago.  I felt embarrassed when I watched it and decided to never let myself go low (for better and for worse).  The anger should be placed not on the patient, but on the unfairness of a dangerous illness, and the anger should be processed and let go.  It's a hard film to watch for a lot of reasons, but you have an inside view as a T1.  Try to look at the character with compassion and empathy, and let's be thankful for the scientists and doctors who have pursued ways to make our lives more tolerable and longer, with better quality!"

And carb counting wasn’t taught. The prevailing theory at that time was “no sugar” and it was ok to eat it. And dosing for short-acting insulin was a guess based on what your glucose was 2 hours post meal when you first were diagnosed.

All that said, I’ve been the diabetic who dropped so low so fast that I refused juice. The rational part of my brain simply didn’t work any longer. I was super combative and convinced I was fine and didn’t need any juice. Because I’M FINE and NOT LOW. I actually remember screaming that at various loved ones more than once in my 36 years of dealing with T1D.

So, while not every diabetic reacts like that, some do. And it’s usually the result of a fast and severe drop, the time when you most need help.

Re: the baby, Julia Robert’s character very obviously had issues controller her A1C, which is not uncommon, even today. So the level of strain on her system could very easily have triggered longer term issues like kidney failure (ultimate cause of death)."

The movie might not feel like an old one and watching it as a diabetic it's pretty wild (saw it too a few months back) but we are watching it with a modern perspective. And even if many places in the late 80's was well informed, a rural area is also different and as we all know, even today people have no idea really. So combined with writers with possiblity little to no knowledge, It doesn't surprise me at all. 

There are still places in the world that have what feels like ancient knowledge and I've visited places where a type 1 diagnosis is a ""death sentence"" yes that sounds dramatic but in many poor countries, village doctors can't even measure someone's sugars and access to insulin will never be a possibility."

Our knowledge and treatment options have expanded so much since the 1980s (hell, even in the last 10 years).  I like to think that, had Shelby been alive today, she would have a CGM and insulin pump, both of which would help her pay better attention to her care.

All 4 with very little complications (the first was an emergency caesarean but nothing to do with diabetes) all others were planned c-sections after the 2nd decided he wanted to be breech & refused to move. Standard practice in the UK at that time was after 2 sections they wouldn’t risk a vaginal birth. All perfectly normal birthweights (heaviest was 7lb 6oz) others were similar numbers. All now fit healthy adults. And no my control was not perfect with any of them. More luck than judgement? Possibly we’ll never really know; but things are advancing all the time with tech & I’ve seen a lot of them over the last 48yrs of it having to live with me

People did treat us worse back then because highs and lows were more common. Two of my schoolmates died before age 40 from complications, and one wasn't diagnose until he was 30. The docs never put him on a modern regimen, I guess. He had a heart attack from running high all the time.

I didn't know anything about the plot, just that it was considered a classic and had Dolly Parton in it. That was it. It heavily irritated me for a lot of the same reasons. I *know* 1989 was a different time but even outside of it they treat her like a small child. No one seems to truly respect her autonomy. It came off as patronizing and ignorant at best. Combine that with how glaringly segregated the cast was to the point that I thought it was a *significantly* older film(I thought it was early-mid seventies, not *1989.*) *and* my already existing extreme annoyance with the kind of religious platitudes many characters give, I really didnt enjoy it at all. My friends watching it with me were also quite disappointed.  Shouldve chosen to watch Fried Green Tomatoes that was my other option, lmao"

It’s her wedding day, so she was likely super unaware of her lows because of excitement. The playwright also wrote the play for his sister Susan who passed away from a similar kidney issue. I actually had a low onstage that felt similar to what Shelby must have experienced. I felt similarly ti her because I wanted to force normal in the moment. 

It was important to me, as a somebody with T1D in 2023, to portray recovery time and realism as much as possible. Because plays are condensed timelines the event feels weird and pushed and rushed. I had to constantly redirect the not diabetics in the room because they kept calling it an “insulin attack” and not “low blood sugar from too much insulin”. The play is a little better than what the movie does, but hey. Drama and exaggeration gets you Oscar nominations. Haha"

Those old meters were very different from the finger stick kits of today, too. They required really big drops of blood, so you had to prick deeper than you do now. You squeezed the blood on to the strip, then you had to wipe the strip with a cotton ball at some point in the process, then insert the strip into the meter. Between the big drops and the wiping, you sometimes got blood on your clothes, down your arm, on the surface where you were testing, etc. It could be messy. Then you had to wait several minutes to get the reading results. And those kits were big! Impossible to hide if you needed to take it to work or school or on a date or whatever."

Sometimes there’s a weird survival instinct that kicks in and has you “come to” surrounded by the trash from all the carbs you ate without knowing you were eating - sort of like being blackout drunk.

In an ideal world, you run normal enough most of the time and these kinds of things are rare enough to just be scary nightmares.

Before CGM, those of us who ran hypoglycemic unaware just did finger stick tests entirely too many times every day - any time anything new/different/exciting/stressful happened, you did a finger stick test, just to be safe."

I’m sorry if this is a silly question,https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14srepd/can_we_take_nyquil/,"Also, the spike isn’t likely to be high enough to kill you or anything.

(Help) My feet started burning,I was just diagnosed with diabetes on may 22 2023. So its been a little over a month and today at work this morning my feet have started to burn(mostly in my toes). The burning is persistent throughout the whole day and constant. I thought the feeling would pass but it hasn’t. I don’t see any ulcer to my knowledge and my feet aren’t hot to the touch. I have a small cut on the side of my big toe but it doesn’t seem to be infected and is healing. It was just so sudden and the burning is semi intense. What should I do? Is this something that I need to go to the ER for? I’m very worried about this any info would be appreciated.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14stsj0/help_my_feet_started_burning/,"Could be peripheral neuropathy started by bringing your glucose levels back under control vs pre diagnosis. It’s somewhat rare but not unheard of. The good thing is that generally isn’t long lasting damage and will subside. 

The bad news is, that’s fucking nerve pain, nothing really touches it directly. Pain killers don’t handle nerve pain. You can get some ALA which will probably help. It’s regarded as the best non rx treatment and it has no side effects I’d absolutely start there with like 600mg a day. Also make sure you get all your b vitamins. From there, gabapentin generally works well with an rx. If it persists I would absolutely discuss with endocrinologist asap and bring it up with them regardless. 

I feel for you homie, nerve pain can be absolutely savage and unrelenting and make it impossible to sleep. But you are newly diabetic so there’s no way you’re dealing with standard diabetic peripheral neuropathy from years of poor control and damage to nerve sheaths. Burning is unpleasant but it isn’t the shocking shooting pain that runs up your entire leg and goes from 0 to an 8 on the pain scale every 5-30 seconds. That shit is literal torture albeit also rare. You’re almost assuredly dealing with your nerves being unhappy about the change in blood glucose - a good thing in the long run but a shock to the system in the short term."

To avoid lows and keep your BG from dropping throughout the day, you need to lower your lantus. If this causes you to go higher after meals, your lantus had previously been covering your meals partially, so you will need more rapid insulin at meals after lowering your lantus to the right dose. 149 is not too high to spike after meals and frequent lows can be dangerous, so it’s important that you fix the lows (get the lantus right) before worrying about the highs"

Try checking your blood sugar right before you eat dose correctly and then wait 2 hours and check it again.   That might give you a more normalized result on your fast acting. 

But you're definitely dosing to much lantus.     
Also most people that have type 1 when they do work out it makes you go low anyways regardless of what you're doing.
Maybe try eating a decent Carby snack before you workout like 20 20 g or so with no insulin."

My suggestion is to 
1) split your dose every 12 hours 
2) reduce your dose for sure 
3) play with your bolus, if youre running high after meals then perhaps give yourself a little more bolus. 
4) adjust, adjust , adjust. Getting basal/bolus right is hard but once you do it’s worth it. 

When I was on MDI my best success was getting my basal as low as I could do it. If I didn’t I would just drop. 
Also, for me running a little bit higher wound be better than treating lows every morning. For example,You could go for a walk to bring that 150 down. I would prefer a walk to treating a low."

Then, say you don’t eat all day, you should still stay within the same range. 

If you drop low between meals or if you skip a meal, your basal is too high.

I do intermittent fasting and sometimes don’t eat for 18-20 hours (usually 14-16) and stay in range! It’s been so freeing. So the first basal test for you should be overnight, aim for 12 hours without eating (if you can!) so stop at like 9pm and resume at 9am. This will give you excellent overnight basal information. See what your blood sugar does and where you start/end up. You might need to do this for a couple weeks before you have it right. The only goal at first is to make sure you’re good overnight. Then, IF you can, prolong breakfast or skip it to see how the morning goes. Or if you can’t skip breakfast cuz you’re hungry or whatever that’s fine, eat breakfast, dose, and skip lunch and wait until dinner to see how you do. It’s gonna be a lot of testing and maybe some annoyances. Try to limit weird stuff like don’t also try to walk during the practice times if you can help it, or eat crazy huge meals outside of your norm. If you need a break and don’t want to do it everyday that’s fine just do it a few times a week. I’m telling you once you have your basal set everything else will become so much easier and won’t feel so hard. It’s a lot of effort to get it all set up but once you do you’ll have a much more predictable day. Of course there will be off days for illness or menstruating or it’s too hot or your walk was “too long” or you haven’t worked out in a week and that changes things too you know but 90% of the time things will be more predictable. Then you can start paying closer attention to how different meals affect you and what might need two boluses a couple hours apart etc and really fine tune your care to be much easier. I think it’s incredibly important to know how insulin works in your body and not enough people take that seriously. Now you totally can! Let me know how else I can help.

It’s making daily life hard and functioning to get normal everyday tasks done difficult and annoying. I’m on MDI and I don’t know how to function as a normal person without this making me go low. Any help or advice please? What helped you, suggestions, etc? Thanks everyone!

Edit: thank you all for commenting and giving advice! I see people saying lower the Lantus dose, but the thing is, I’ve tried lowering it to 18, then 15, but then when I bolus for meals, instead of nirmal bloods coming back, I’ll be at 149ish after meals and I don’t want to be that high.

There's so much more to it. Because it's so complex, it's impossible to have perfect control all of the time - imperfect control should just be accepted as inevitable and not as a failure, so long as the right intention was there.

the second thing you need to know is that, despite the complexity, it IS manageable, especially with the technology available now. Also, the more you research, learn and understand about the disease, all of the different impacts it has on various metabolic processes, how insulins of various kinds work (and how that is different to how insulin from an unimpaired pancreas works), etc. the more manageable it becomes - and it's fasinating to learn.

For me, diabetes was a good teacher as I learned to make wise food choices and remain physically active, inspired by Bill Talbert https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill\_Talbert the tennis player -- he was diagnosed at age 10. Treatment/management has made tremendous strides since I began this journey and phase 1 and 2 clinical trials are underway now for a cure that evades the immune system.

The learning curve is steep but your pediatric endocrinology team should be the resource for climbing the learning curve. The tools for managing today e.g., continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and insulin pump are the closest thing to a cure until there is one. I use a Dexcom G6 sensor, Tandem t:slim X2 insulin pump. with iPhone/Apple Watch. A glance at my watch shows the sensor reading and the trend so, if need be, I can make changes. The CGM reading via iPhone can be shared, so you can be the management backup.

Don't fret, he will be fine and will eventually benefit from the cure that is in the not too distant future. Even with my comparatively crude management tools at the start, I flourished, completed my studies and had a career taking me to three continents. I met my wife on a tennis court. I ride a bike, play tennis, and cross-country ski with my four adult children and two grandchildren. I'm in better health than some folks my age.

My (long) story will put this journey in perspective and show where we've been and where we're going.

My heart goes out to your son.  The next few months are going to be really difficult, no doubt about it. One thing that I promise you is that it gets way way way easier. Hang in there the best you can.  Early on don’t worry to much about blood sugar being on the higher end, just worry about lows as that is the immediate danger. Invest in a cgm asap, asap, asap , it is life changing and an absolute must to get. As you adjust into this having real time blood sugar data will speed up your knowledge 10x. You will learn really quickly how carbs and insulin effect his blood sugar. The other thing is it will allow him and yourself to get a good nights sleep (which will be really tough right off the bat). Your boy is likely going to go through what is referred to as the honeymoon period, where his pancreas is still sort of working sometimes. Makes things at times unpredictable, but this does settle down.  

  Don’t beat yourself up. Support the best you can. You will mourn your old life, but do your best to move on as quick as possible for your sons sake ! Cry in private, smile in front of him!  

Things are going to be okay. I promise.  It’s a tricky learning curve but you and him can do it. He can still do absolutely everything I’m this world, it just takes a little more planning!

Sending some prayers your way. Don’t be afraid to ask for help or advice whenever you need it !"

The only things I’d add at this point is (1) Yes, there is a huge learning curve and lifestyle change as you learn about counting carbs, insulin dosing, technology and all the ins and outs of managing TID. But I’d encourage you to be mindful that there’s a huge emotional component to T1D that is sort of the elephant in the room, the thing not really discussed. When I was first diagnosed, I worked with a therapist who specializes in chronic diseases. It was really helpful and I’d still be going to her if she still practiced. You might want to consider therapy for the child and maybe even for you, but even that if you don’t, the emotional aspect — the anger, the embarrassment, the confusion, whatever — is real, and managing that is part of managing the TID. (2) As you advocate for your child, and you’ll definitely have to with TID, be sure to teach, coach and encourage the child to advocate for himself as well. Especially at age 10, he’s crossing a threshold into greater independence. You can’t always be there for him. We teach our kids to respect authority and to follow the rules, but when it comes to managing his TID, one of the greatest gifts you can give him is to support him as his own advocate. One day some teacher or coach will tell him he can’t have his snack or not let him have juice to treat a low or whatever, and he needs to know it’s OK to disobey in those situations and to take care of himself.

Welcome to the awful club (for you and your kid.)

I have a booklet detailing a lot of tips and tricks and information on T1, I’m happy to send you a link if you’d like to read it. 

I suppose my biggest pieces of advice would be:

There are 42 known factors that affect how insulin responds in your body, and consequently, your blood sugar. This disease is a lot more complex than “take insulin, eat carbs” and sometimes nothing you do will make sense. And that’s ok, because there are days when you will conquer diabetes, and there will be days when diabetes will throw you around like a tornado. Go to bed, get up, and start afresh the next morning.

https://diatribe.org/42-factors-affect-blood-glucose-surprising-update

Also, learn to look at blood sugar measurements as numbers. It’s not good or bad, just data to indicate how you are doing and what your next steps are going to be."

Diagnosed when I was 9. This is scary for you all and we understand and empathize. He will be fine if you and he learn about T1D and learn it is a condition that he can deal with. While I wouldn’t wish this on anyone, I have always felt blessed I got it early because my eating habits were not fully set. I adjusted to a healthier diet easier. I was a Joslin kid. The Joslin Clinic in Boston has always been the world leader in R&D and patient care. 

I highly recommend getting a good education. https://www.joslin.org/patient-care/diabetes-education-library

I also recommend he go to a T1D camp. I attended Camp Joslin and it set the tone for my approach to dealing with my condition. Everything is possible - with proper planning. The friends he makes will teach him he is not alone and the education in self care is excellent. Plus it is a lot of fun. Maybe next summer or the next. 

Last piece of advice - don’t overthink it. There is no way to totally control blood sugar levels so just aim for a range and know there will be times that things get bonkers for no good reason. 

I’ve had a great and adventurous life. So can he. He’s just a little sweeter now (my Mom’s joke)."

I know it can be stressful, and most certainly for the parent (sometimes it feels my mom is more stressed than me), but there are always good resources, tips, videos, and especially books to find!

I'm glad your son is taking it well. That always helps in the long run.

Something you should know about early though is fat and protein bolusing. It really helps. I don't have the exact ratio of F&P to carbs, but it really made a difference whenever I had a fatty meal."

It’ll come in handy, especially because so many questions arise when first diagnosed!

And of course! I’d love to give a little insight! I definitely recommend seeing if there is a therapist in your area who specializes in T1D kids. My parents did this for me a few years into my diagnosis and it helped a lot to have a professional who understood type 1 diabetes that I could talk to. It was a little after I started exhibiting signs of depression and anxiety (it doesn’t happen to every type 1, but it is more common in those of us with it). Having so many things going on in such a short amount of time was extremely difficult (not to mention just being a pre-teen/teen), so it was almost essential having a therapist. She even worked at a Diabetes Camp for kids and took me one time- it was an awesome experience. Not to mention, it’s just so helpful to have someone when you’re newly diagnosed and frustrated at times and need someone to talk to! 


Also, definitely look into kids’ Diabetes Camp! I never got to go as an actual camper, just the one time I went with my therapist to assist, but I’ve heard such good things about them- he’ll get to meet other kids with it and make friends. Of course, it’s not for every kid, especially if he’s shy he might not want to do it. But it’s worth looking into, and seeing if he’d be interested if there’s one near you! 

Also since he’s young, you might need a babysitter at one point and there’s an excellent resource for finding babysitters for T1D kids! It’s from @typeonetogether on IG- the main reason I know of this is because I’ve met the person who started it and she’s created something amazing for parents and T1D kids! [Here’s](https://www.typeonetogether.com/?referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fl.instagram.com%2F) the website as well! There are so many resources on the site and some really cute plushies that are wearing CGMs and pumps that I think would be so cute for kids! I think it’s an amazing place to start and there’s a community you can join for T1D parents!

As for devices, if you’re able to get one, I highly recommend the Dexcom. The G7 just came out and would be worth talking with his endo about! If not, the last generation, the G6 (which I have) is also great and works with certain pumps currently (I.e. Tandem T:slim and Omnipod 5). You can get the “Follow” app and connect it to his Dexcom and be alerted when he has highs and/or lows. It’s so worth it, in my opinion. I don’t have a child, but my dad also has type one and we have each other on the app and call if we get an alert that the other person is low to check in. It’s great! 

Also for pumps, if he’s interested and you’re able, it’s a great way to receive his insulin therapy. It can communicate with CGMs (depending on the pump/CGM) and bolus for him. I’ve had a couple kinds- I don’t personally recommend anything from Medtronic (I’ve never had a good experience with anything of theirs and a lot of people tend to have complaints about their devices), but I do recommend the Omnipod 5 or T:Slim. The Omnipod is tube-free which might work better with your son since he is young and most likely very active as a kid. The T:Slim is what I’m currently on (just recently) and it’s amazing, but it has tubing. This is definitely something to bring up to his Endo when/if he is ever interested to get more information! But this is just a little info from someone who’s tried a few things! Insulin pens are also a great option- it all depends on how he wants to control it, and he might not know until he’s a little older (which is what happened with me)! 

I hope this info helps and please feel free to message me if you ever need anything or have a question! But I have a feeling you’ll find a great community of T1 parents on Type One Together, as well as on here!"

An important aspect of managing at his age is to recognize that the balance of insulin, food, and physical activity will remain a moving target and he'll require more insulin as he matures. Stress or anxiety about school, deadlines, social/peer issues, common cold or injury, will also contribute to elevated blood glucose. Due to these additional factors carb counting is only a guidepost. That's why I don't think about achieving perfection, I can only approach perfection and my sensor alerts are set at 70mg/dL and170 mg/dL.

I use Baqsimi, which is a nasal spray, so it’s extremely easy and even teachers can administer it with no problem. When the new school year comes around, definitely make sure he has one with him at all times and that teachers/coaches/school nurses know that he has it. 

Also, be aware that kids (at least when I was one) have a very skewed idea of what type one diabetes is and there are definitely ignorant things said. I’ve had everything you could possibly think of said to me (every T1D I know has), and it’s a horrible side effect of having a disease that the general public is not educated about. Maybe it’s different in schools these days- I hope it is. Just support him and let him know that none of this is his fault. He did absolutely nothing to make it happen, and kids can be cruel.

If the CGM and/or pump fails, he needs to be able to use finger stick monitoring and be confident in using injections until he can get a new pump on.

It’s technology, it can fail. They don’t often, but he needs to have basic non-technical skills of finger prick testing and manual injections in case he needs to use it."

T1D for 5 years I am 29 male",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14sbx4d/type_1_controled_only_with_long_acting_insulin/,"This is incorrect. Incretin mimetics (the “superclass” into which GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic fall) have a multitude of effects, only one of which is increasing insulin secretion. They also suppress excess glucagon secretion (which enhances the effects of insulin- whether injected or natural). They increase satiety (reduce appetite), which can be beneficial as well. And, most importantly, they increase non-insulin-mediated glucose metabolism. 

DPP4-is (the first incretin drugs) increase levels of GLP-1 and other incretins by inhibiting the enzyme that breaks them down. But, they’re basically the equivalent of a biological sledgehammer. GLP-1 drugs are more narrowly tailored, targeting a specific receptor. The newest ones (Mounjaro and other drugs in development/testing) target additional incretin receptors beyond just the GLP-1r, but are still much more narrowly tailored in their action than DPP-4is."

Type 1 Diabetic Story Character. Need Help for Research Purposes,"Hi guys,

First time here. I sincerely pray the doctors and scientists find a decent cure for both diabetes types. 

I’m not sure what is the proper etiquette but I wanted to learn more about Type 1 diabetes. I am writing a novel where my male protagonist has Type 1 since he was 10. He is 25 now. I wanted to do an accurate portrayal. Everyone in my family has Type 2 and as per my Google research, there are many differences between both of these. I can’t get help from family. 

Google has so much information but I need anecdotal evidence for my story as well.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Question 1: What happens when your sugar drops too much when you’re driving? How bad can it get without needing to go to the hospital? 

Question 2: can you have ice cream?

Question 3: how many insulin injections do you normally take (bolus vs basal)? Is it on the arms or stomach or thigh?

Question 4: anything you’d like me to know to make my character true? Things people might not normally know. Biggest challenge being Type 1.

Usually the shakiness starts than the sweats and confusion. It can feel like you are falling into a perilous state depending on how fast you are dropping. Can be very intense. Can also be quite mild. There’s a lot of factors. Typically carb load and reason for dropping what determine how severe it is. Lots of insulin no food. Bad bad low. Exercise with food. Decent low but usually much not manageable. Something like that. So if you want him to have a bad low while driving say he miscounted his carbs and have too much insulin. Or soemthing like that. Or overestimasted for the cinnamon buns. 

2. Absolutely. No issues. Just need to take the correct bolus for the carbs. 

3. When I was on mdis (manual daily injections) legs thighs and arms are all fair game. Even the back fat above your butt is good to use. Injections are generally done with every meal when carbs are eaten. With a 24hr long acting or 2 12 hrs long acting shots. Usually in the morning or supper. The amount varies widely amongst people. I average about 60-70 units per day total. But this can change depending on what I am eating. 
Edit: forgot injections can also be done 2 hours post good for corrections. Average 3-8 injections a day. Depending on skipping meals and such and insulin regime. 

4.  This is a loaded question because everyone has it different. I would say being that it is an invisible disease. You wouldn’t know I am chronically ill in any regard by looking at me. A long with the type 2 stigma that exists such as I caused it by eating too much sugar or it is curable through exercise and diet. 

Hope that helps. If you have any direct questions I would be happy to answer them as well. Had t1 since I was 11 and am now 31. I could be your protagonist haha. Just jokes. Best of luck with the writing."

First time here. I sincerely pray the doctors and scientists find a decent cure for both diabetes types. 

I’m not sure what is the proper etiquette but I wanted to learn more about Type 1 diabetes. I am writing a novel where my male protagonist has Type 1 since he was 10. He is 25 now. I wanted to do an accurate portrayal. Everyone in my family has Type 2 and as per my Google research, there are many differences between both of these. I can’t get help from family.

Question 1: What happens when your sugar drops too much when you’re driving? How bad can it get without needing to go to the hospital? 

Question 2: can you have ice cream?

Question 3: how many insulin injections do you normally take (bolus vs basal)? Is it on the arms or stomach or thigh?

Question 4: anything you’d like me to know to make my character true? Things people might not normally know. Biggest challenge being Type 1.

Lows in general (not driving) I get sweaty, shaky, heart palpitations, hungry, lack focus, and sometimes act drunk if I’m really low. Driving is a hard one because quite frankly a lot of us have cgms and I personally always look at mine or finger stick before I drive. You can get into a ton of trouble legally if a low happens when you drive so I’ve been very diligent about making sure I’m in a safe spot. I also carry a ton of non perishable snacks in my car- glucose tabs, granola bars etc plus usually have some sort of sugar source in my purse like gummies or a small juice box, skittles.
2. You bet! Just had some tonight actually :)
3. I’m on a pump now but basal- 1 shot daily, for boluses you need to anytime you eat carbs so I’d say the average person does at least 4 for meals/and a snack and then maybe 1-2 for corrections as needed.
4. I think it would be cool to show true diabetic thoughts. Have someone say something to the main character like “you have to take shots, I couldn’t do it”. And then have him have some inner monologue like “you’d do it if the choice is that or die” or better yet have him say it to that persons face.  I think it would be cool to have a character that leaves test strips around because almost all diabetics I know try their best to keep up with their test strip trashing but don’t 😂 have him break a vial of insulin and talk about how expensive it is"

I would say these things are not talked about much in a type 1's offline world:

1. Every day has a time tax paid by carb counting, estimating, noticing, checking, stopping to wonder.
2. Every day blends together, so how to keep track of:
a. Pump sites on 3 day rotation
b. Cgm sites on 7 day rotation
c. Insulin prescription on a 30 day? Month? 31 day? 90 day? Refill schedule. 
d. Pump supplies and cgm supplies as durable medical but with a prescription.
e. Having refills and supplies denied at random times as insurance has a new formulary, or has a form to confirm you still need the insulin.
3. You need your endocrynologist, your primary care doctor, your certified diabetes educator, but you also train them, a lot.
4. Walking out the door, right on time, ripping a pump site, cgm off on anything like a seatbelt. Late.
5. Alarms. Some telling you things you know, like your blood glucose is high and you just corrected, but your cgm pump algorithm isn't sure you remember from 10 minutes ago. Alarms for lows while sleeping, alarms for low battery, for cgm ending, alarms that you didnt finish a bolus, alarms when you don't want them like at a concert, wedding, or meeting.

Most T1s have normal days, to the point that many people they are around don't know much. 

T1 is like a second part time job you cannot quit.

Most T1s have stories of people who want to give them insulin when they are low, take away their sugar as they eat, ask them why they are taking so long as the tech does everything, and also get asked how or what did they eat to cause this.

I agree with the others, it will be a challenge to write a main character with T1 without much direct experience of T1."

I personally would never go to the hospital, unless I got so low I passed out and an ambulance took me. I keep starburst or glucose tabs in my car for lows. 

2. Yes to ice cream! Always yes! I can eat anything I want, I just have to inject insulin, instead of my body producing it. 

3. Bolus injections are 3-5x a day usually. Bolus is given when eating or corrections. Basal (if on pump is continuous throughout the day, you set it up on your pump and it does it automatically). If not on a pump you usually take one large long acting insulin dose a day. 

4. Honestly, it’s definitely not like type 2 at all. 
It bothers me that it is called the same disease. Most general public and doctors don’t know much about type 1 and make assumptions based on type 2. We are just normal people, except we wear (or inject) our insulin and always carry snacks on us. 

P.s Looped systems have made it super easy and manageable, it’s been life changing for this disease. 

If you have any question, please reach out. I’m always up to spread awareness on the reality of the minority known as type 1."

Thank you once again!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14rqtjp/type_1_diabetic_story_character_need_help_for/,"1. Being low in general makes you more woozi. You start getting tired/lethargic and you can't properly streamline your thoughts. Lots of people compare being low to being drunk. Normally just because of experience, you can feel if you're high or low, but it becomes really hard to do so when you're focused on something. So when you drive, sometimes you don't pay attention or from an okay level it spikes down (maybe from workout or stress or something). In my experience, my driving just gets noticeably worse (e.g. crappy turns, bad break control, etc), I've never really gone in a super dangerous low while driving nor had an accident from it. If I'm low before driving, I drink and eat, wait 20-30mins, then drive if my scanner says I'm okay. If while driving, depending how bad, I'll just continue or hazard somewhere safe to eat/drink. 

As for the low part, I've gotten as low as 17mg/dL  but I still didn't go to the hospital. I think the general consensus of most T1D is if your low, just eat or drink and you'll be fine in a few mins. You'll only ever go to the ER and spend way more money than a simple juice box if you pass out or collapse.


2. Yes. It's a common misconception that T1D can't because of the sugar, but the real answer is, it's just a pain to correct. Don't get me wrong, I love sweets and as long as I can correct the right amount of insulin, it's all fine and dandy. But it gets annoying and expensive to do it all the time. Imagine using up half a meal's worth of bolus on a slice of highly frosted cake. 

3. I use a pump and it's on a regular basal. I would usually just eat the same things everyday, with some exceptions, which makes my basal and bolus per day essentially the same. Aside from eating different food, exercising changes how much insulin I use. The more active you are, the less insulin you need because your muscles/body becomes more efficient in absorbing insulin. 

As for basal, I have 3 different basals at different times. Regular waking hours (8am-12am), it'll be 0.4 per hour. Then in the first few hours of sleep, it's heavily reduced to 0.2 (12-3am). Then to counter the dawn phenomenon, It spikes up to 0.7 (3am till awake).

The good thing about basal and bolus is that it's very adjustable. I keep a food diary to check my BG at different times and what rises after certain foods. This is a very good reference for what I need to change if I notice a trend in highs or lows after certain foods.

4. I'd say the mental aspect of it, not being able to live like other people, having to rely on someone else, and not being able to live a normal life. For me, I was a student athlete (performer) back in highschool and am currently still very active in my lifestyle (gym, volleyball, runs, etc). There would be so many times where I would have to stop my training, be late, or even cut mid-performance because my BG was all over the mess. On a regular day, oh well it happens. But when you hit a low and depressed stage every so often, you start thinking ""why can't I do things or that"", ""why am I not good enough"". It's also one of the reasons I started playing video games cause it's very not physically demanding, so I could still do an activity with others, without messing with my BG too much. 

When I was younger, I had a hard time distinguishing inability vs capability. If I couldn't do something because of my diabetes, I would blame myself for not being good enough. I would also feel extremely guilty about the amount of money needed to keep me alive with all the testing kits, insulin, etc. It took a toll on my mental health, and made it so I never felt good enough because I always felt like a burden to someone, whether it be my parents, coach, teammates, and even myself. To some extent it's still true in my life now, but definitely has gotten better the longer time passes and has since grown to accept it. Though my sickness does not define me, it is part of who I am.

My daughter has an alarm that goes off urgently at 55 so staying below that for too long can lead to those symptoms. It is definitely not a good idea to be behind the wheel of a moving vehicle while experiencing these symptoms, as they can lead to accidents.

2) yes t1d can eat ice cream as long as they dose for it properly. We're always checking our levels to make sure we're in a proper blood sugar range

3) most t1d take a daily basal (long acting) that helps balance their levels over the course of the day. Some take 2 doses of basal. Bolus is usually used at meal times and in cases of high blood sugar levels. Anywhere from 3-7 times a day, depending on how many times you eat or correct

4) if your character ever gets sick in your story, it's important to know that they will need to be more aware of their levels and something called ketones. There are a couple of different ways to check for ketones, some glucometers can actually check them, but it is very important that your character at least be a little more active in their level management if they get sick. It can lead to a hospital stay if their ketones get too high"

Other times she says she just feel ""off"" and catches the low before her cgm does. On the flip side tho, she was diagnosed when she was dka. This happens (generally) when sugar levels are too high and ketones develop. For her, she was unconscious with labored breathing for about 2 days. It started with her throwing up, we thought was just a stomach virus. 4 hours later she was talking but not feeling well but not throwing up anymore. An hour after 30 mins after that she started talking gibberish. Kind of like sleep talking. 15 mins later she was unconscious. At one point her temp was so low the only way they could even get it to register was rectally. Hers was a little extreme but dka is dangerous and life threatening if untreated and can happen from uncontrolled levels, or dehydration from being sick (among other things).

2) She can have anything and everything she wants, as long as she doses for it (if needed)


3) Since a lot of people have already kind of explained the differences between bolus and basal, I'll add the younger the kid the less insulin needed. As they grow and age they will need more insulin. It varies a lot between person to person, but the amount a 5 year old and 12 year old would need would be vastly different. Without getting too technical, it's based on how many carbs food has, but the amount given per carb varies per person and is worked out with your doctor. And can change. A lot of people have different amounts for day vs night, or when sick, or highly active/working out, women sometimes have different amounts for when they are on their periods, etc. The amount needed for corrections can change too, but at least for us hasn't been a huge difference so far. 


We're still MDI with plans to move to a pump after he honeymoon isn't so intense (I skimmed the other comments and didn't see this info, sorry if it's a repeat and sorry for writing a mini novel, lol) so we still give insulin manually. We, and I think probably most who are MDI, use insulin pens. She has 2 different ones, 1 for the long lasting, which she gets once a day. And 1 for her bolus. She keeps 1 of each on her at all times and the rest in the fridge. To use them, you have to insert a needle cap. It screws on the top of the pen and is a one time use that gets disposed of in a sharps container. There's a know on the end that's like a dial. You always wanna do a little test squirter first, make sure there's no air bubbles. You dial the knob to the number of units you're injecting, insert on push down on the top of the dial. And then unscrew the needle and dispose of it. There is still insulin in a vial, used with a syringe, I could guess on how that'd work based on other medication injections in our family but I'm not familiar with that specifically. The pens are the size of a marker maybe a little longer. They always remind me of Copic markers, lol. 


4) my daughter is 15 and I think the biggest thing she's struggled with so far is that it's literally life or death and for her it was almost death. She's worried about how accessible literal life saving medication will be once she's an ""adult"" and responsible for her own health insurance. And she's worried about how it'll affect ""normal"" growing up experiences.... dating, working, driving, eventually drinking and having sex. Also, most, if not all of us have a ""low"" kit. For us that looks like an easy to get to basket with a glucometer (she does have a cgm, but with highs and lows we double check with a finger stick, sometimes the cgms can be wayyy off and fixing a high/low when it's not actually that number can be dangerous. In general cgms run 10ish mins behind a finger stick test. Sorry, again I feel like I'm writing waaayyyy too much! Glucometers test your blood, where as the cgm tests the interstitial fluid. With a sharp rise or a quick fall that 10 mins could be a big deal.) So, we will double check the number. You want some quick acting carbs, we've got juice boxes, skittles and pink Starburst lol, because those are her favorites, but quick and you only need a few. But generally it's about 15g of carbs. Wait 15 mins and then you re check with another finger stick. (In this situation the cgm wouldn't have updated yet with the sugar that was just given, so looking at cgm it might say she was still low when she actually wasn't anymore.) Sometimes you have to repeat once or twice. There's also glucose tabs but she doesn't like them so we don't keep them. There's glucagon that is  an injectable, and can be used more then once in the same situation or basquimi which is a one time use inhaleable. This is for emergencies, if she was super low and unconscious. We were advised to call 911 if we ever have to use it. She carries glucagon in her purse also, with her other diabetic supplies and I carry the basquimi (I might be spelling that wrong but it's close enough that Google would know what it is and give you the right spelling, lol) in both out purses we also carry a small tube of icing gel (the little ones used for writing on cakes, not the big decorating ones). If she was ever in a situation where she was throwing up or unable to swallow, where choking was a concern, you can rub it right into their gums. 

I'm sorry I wrote so much, lol. I always write too much, but this time especially, all this info is fresh in my brain because we've learned it all this year. And I'm the type of person who does a ton of research for everything, and it's not the kind of stuff that comes up in everyday convo lol. So thanks for letting me empty my brain lol. If you have any other questions, please ask, or feel free to pm if you'd prefer.


One last thing, I think this is really nice. There's not a ton of t1 representation, let alone positive representation in media. (The only one I could think of when she was first diagnosed was baby sitters club and she went back and re read a bunch of the series), so I think it's super cool someone wants to get some out there, and is taking the time to do the research, and get the input, to make sure your portrayal is accurate. So, thank you!"
Type 1 Diabetic Story Character. Need Help for Research Purposes,"Hi guys,

First time here. I sincerely pray the doctors and scientists find a decent cure for both diabetes types. 

I’m not sure what is the proper etiquette but I wanted to learn more about Type 1 diabetes. I am writing a novel where my male protagonist has Type 1 since he was 10. He is 25 now. I wanted to do an accurate portrayal. Everyone in my family has Type 2 and as per my Google research, there are many differences between both of these. I can’t get help from family. 

Google has so much information but I need anecdotal evidence for my story as well.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Question 1: What happens when your sugar drops too much when you’re driving? How bad can it get without needing to go to the hospital? 

Question 2: can you have ice cream?

Question 3: how many insulin injections do you normally take (bolus vs basal)? Is it on the arms or stomach or thigh?

Question 4: anything you’d like me to know to make my character true? Things people might not normally know. Biggest challenge being Type 1.

Thank you once again!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14rqtjp/type_1_diabetic_story_character_need_help_for/,"1: Depends on the severity, but any level of starting to crash (go low) is gonna be a matter of start fixing it. If my cgm tells me its starting but i dont feel it, id pop glucose tablets and be very aware of how i was feeling for longer drives. If im feeling it, im pulling over and calling work or wherever im going to say i might be late. As for going to the hospital, i once hit twelve mg/dl and still didnt go being an american. 

Earlier signs for me start as a slight tingling in my finger tips and a bit of an upset stomach. I then start shaking but i often dont notice it unless i look at my hand to check. After a bit my heart feels like its piunding harder but not faster (like, ill set my phone on my chest while laying down and see it move with each heartbeat). And the gross feeling cold sweats where you feel like you are absolutely drenched and sooo fucking cold. 

There can also be some trippy visual effects where near and far become hard to discern, and light is amplified by a thousand. 

2: yes. Honestly in theory we can eat what we want as long as we bolus ahead of time (times vary person to person, i usually aim for about 20 minutes). Though processing that much sugar can make me feel sick and gross, even if my blood sugar never actually goes high so i still dont often do it. 

3: I personally take usually 6 or 7. I take tresiba (long lasting) twice a day (20 in the morning, 10 at night) and novolog (fast acting) i usually take at least 3 times for three meals, but if im able to, ill break those 3 meals into 5 smaller ones but each would still require a shot, then one or 2 more for corrections if needed. Something not talked about often enough though on this topic is stacking insulin. If you take two separate doses two close together, they can compound and hit harder to induce a crash

4: a couple minor details/experiences you can add in is squirting when doing fingerstick checks. Even with a cgm, i have to occasionally check for calibration or if it malfunctions, but part of that is sometimes when you try to squeeze the sample out, rather than just a drop forming it decides to be a but more projectile. 

On the topic of that: if he's not gonna have a cgm and do regular fingwr stick checks, his lancet will be swapped out at most once a year. 

If he's doing vial and syringe or even pen, if he accidentally injects into a nerve it burns like a bitch. It doesnt happen extremely frequently but it does still happen and it sucks. Other than this, i dont really feel the injections.

With the injections, another problem i run into is if he forgets or fails to make sure he injects into different sites each time, it can cause a build up of scar tissue (ive got a visible lump on my stomach i cant do injections into anymore because it takes that much longer for insulin to get through the thickwr tissue.) 

And if hes doing vial/syringe, the fucking bubbles can be such a pain in the ass to get rid of sometimes."

Most people have CGM’s these days and you can feel your sugar dropping and you can just eat some glucose tabs or whatever you’ve got. I haven’t gone low while driving since I got a CGM, before that I used to test before driving and maybe occasionally I’d pop a glucose tab, I had a container in the center console cup holder. These days tbh I don’t because I don’t go low with a CGM.

Sure you can have ice cream. I thought you said you’ve be looking into this.

These days I use a pump so I give myself one infusion site change every 2-3 days. In the old days, I used to do 5-10 shots a day. In stomach and thighs. 

I have to be honest and say that my confidence in your ability to portray this accurately is not high. I don’t care for it. But it’s fine, write what you want. Good luck."

The main things you need to focus on for me is that yes this condition controls every aspect of your life and it’s a constant thought in your head with planning & calculations playing a huge factor. BUT we can still live ‘normal’ life’s and do pretty much the same as everyone else; go wherever we want; eat whatever we want, drink whatever we want etc etc. we just need to plan ahead some of the time! So I would rather the type 1 played more of a secondary background in the story rather than being the main focus of his character. Because that’s how most of us live! Yes we know we have it but it shouldn’t dictate how we live. So many times when a character has type 1 that’s all they talk about & it’s constantly being mentioned (usually with drama around it too). Lots of us when we are heading low will simply get some sweets or drink some juice & no one around us is even aware we’ve just diced with death. The same when it come to injections; I just wipe my pen out do my injection & carry on. 

One good thing to put in maybe have your character inject in public & have someone make a snide comment about doing it the bathroom. So many diabetics have this stigma that what we’re doing is disgusting or rude & should be hidden away like it’s a secret bit what we’re doing is no different to someone who needs to use their inhaler or even take painkillers. So having more awareness that we are taking essential medication & asking us to leave or not do it in public is actually abusive. 

Please feel free to ask anything you want; I’ve been controlling this condition for 48yrs & have a very positive outlook on my diagnosis which is something I’ve noticed many diabetics don’t have because of all wrong media stigma around it. Diabetes has to live with me; not the other way round"

low blood sugar means ur brain isn't getting the energy ot needs to function, ur brain is shutting down but body goes into fight or flight to try to keep u alive, manners tend to go out the window aswell 


t1d can eat the same as normal people they just have to manually do the work you normies pancreases do.... some ppl night watch what they eat and be supet healthy but aside from less needles/less insulin it makes the same difference that a normal perosn eating healthy makes


infections are pretty much every time you eat or drink anything with sugar/carbs some people eat twice a day some people have a snack every hour so there's not really a correct answer, it's just when your body needs it (you should google what insulin does and why you need it, should help figure out a lot of stuff) 

without Insulin, glucose stays in ur blood and doesn't get turned into energy, ur cells are slowly starved of energy and starts depleting fat/muscle eventually killing you, also basically turns ur blood into acid (diabetic ketoacidos)

any temp above 24 degrees fucks my levels and makes them go super high,

might add more later but all I got for npw"

It would also be absolutely amazing if there will be an opportunity to read your book and that you consider sharing that with us.
 I see you have great answers here in regards to your questions and my biggest input will be your 4th question. My life and lifestyle is pretty alternative and it's created situations and challenges that might not exist for most. I've been told many times that I make things harder than they need to be but I've never NOT done something because I'm diabetic.
I travel alot and have since I was a baby, that didn't stop after my diagnosis 29 years ago at the age of 13. Most of my challenges are related to that.

1. I don't drive so can only tell you how I navigate public transportation, airplanes or days on trains in India.

2. i love ice cream and I eat most things and try everything at least one time. I count carbs with everything I consume and regulate insulin accordingly. 

3. I inject my long lasting every 24 h in my thigh and usually require between 3-5 fast acting injection pr day but if it's necessary there might be more.

4. My personal challenges are often related to travel. Either during travel or access to good medical professionals or insulin. I've been in some crazy situations like being taken into hours of questioning when I traveled to Morocco in the 90's due to drug smuggling suspicion, not being able to access insulin in Nepal because it's so expensive people can't afford it and it's therefore not something most pharmacies have or getting help from doctors without boarder in a South African public hospital that was crawling with cockroaches and not able to treat a type 1 woman who was having a miscarriage. These are off course extreme experiences and I have many more that are not on that level. In my everyday life the most irritating/challenging and neverending issue is the amount of ""alternative"" people who think diabetes can be cured by a herb, poison from a Amazonian frog or reiki. I don't dismiss that there can be benefits from things in nature but as someone whom is alive as a result of modern science there are simply a large amount of suggestions that come from extremely uneducated people who call themselves shamans. People in general also assume I'm interested in their opinions on how I should live, strangers with no basic understanding of type 1 share stories about their type 2 grandmother and that makes them expert. The amount of people more interested in telling me how much they know (often incorrectly) instead of having a conversation where they could be educated always blows my mind."

I was constantly gaslit into believing I was a unhealthy brat, while being raised by an alcoholic. I eventually became scared to test my own blood sugar, as my parents would start screaming at me if my blood sugar was over 200 (believe me, I was scared of high blood sugar for my own sake. I would test my blood sugar probably an average of 15 times a day before this point).

Basically what I am saying, is not all people are fit to be parents, and not all ‘good’ parents are equal. But it is important to observe the psychologically influential factors that exist in your environment in order to walk yourself through a story that is genuine.

4. Memento—I’ve been really, really low but not to the point of passing out and it’s horrible, and there’s no way I would willingly allow myself to die from that. If I remember the movie correctly, she was not asleep when it happened so she probably felt how awful and not quick it is

Thank you once again!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14rqtjp/type_1_diabetic_story_character_need_help_for/,"This character of mine created himself. I can’t change him back to no diabetes no matter how hard I try. My brain refuses to accept the idea after 40 chapters. You guys don’t know how many videos I watched on YouTube from people with Type 1 and I am terrified of needles 😭 
Y’all real soldiers. 

I got the idea from my younger brother’s friend who got diagnosed with T1 in elementary school. That was nearly a decade ago lol. I always had it in the back of my mind that one day, I’d have a diabetic protagonist."
Type 1 Diabetic Story Character. Need Help for Research Purposes,"Hi guys,

First time here. I sincerely pray the doctors and scientists find a decent cure for both diabetes types. 

I’m not sure what is the proper etiquette but I wanted to learn more about Type 1 diabetes. I am writing a novel where my male protagonist has Type 1 since he was 10. He is 25 now. I wanted to do an accurate portrayal. Everyone in my family has Type 2 and as per my Google research, there are many differences between both of these. I can’t get help from family. 

Google has so much information but I need anecdotal evidence for my story as well.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you once again!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14rqtjp/type_1_diabetic_story_character_need_help_for/,"This is a fantastic response. Thank you for including the “types” of lows. Sometimes I don’t feel the low and my Dexcom alerts me. Sometimes I feel like the world is ending and if I don’t eat my entire cabinet of food I’m just going to die. 

One thing: I NEVER let myself go low driving. I live in a very rural place and need to regularly drive 2.5+ hours to and from locations (regularly meaning once a week at least). If I were to have a “bad bad” low while driving where I usually drive it would genuinely mean the end of the world. There is no safely pulling over, there is only perilously pulling over. Hazards do not protect against erratic drivers. 

OP, thank you for asking. If I read one more book with “he felt his blood sugar dropping low, but he thankfully took a quick dose of life-saving insulin”, I’ll have a hysterical fit."

Few questions, if you don’t mind me asking.

- When you put the CGM on, does it hurt? Is there blood? How often do you change it? Does it leave scars?

- Are the insulin pump better than the shots? Is there a reason someone would choose shots over the pump? Say if my character is poor, would he choose the shots for time being?

- Do you ever run into issues with exercising/going to the gym or joining a sport as a T1?"

Think something above 500. It can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis or dka, and can lead to organ failure or a diabetic coma. Also going too low without going to a hospital or eating a proper dose of fat acting carbs can lead to death."

Another good note if you ever put him through dka (Diabetic KetoAcidosus): The most accurate description that i have formed is imagine a hangover that just continues to get worse and worse. You drink, but you just throw it up. As it gets worse, it starts to feel like your lungs themselves are cramping, and each breath becomes painful. Lights are extremely bright, sounds are very loud. 

And as insulin finally kicks in and brings your blood sugar down from a high, you get that ear pressure like you do when on an airplane.

I realized after posting that I didn’t ask about the ice cream properly. I have read through many reddit posts about people saying Halo is a good brand and some others. My question was more towards those random ice cream shops outside (Rita’s, Baskin Robbins, etc) and how a T1 would plan a bolus in advance for such a scenario. Do you guys kind of already have an idea about the carbs and how much insulin would suffice if you indulge in say a Rita’s small vs Medium vs Large Gelati etc?

Definitely could make for an interesting narrative that may find a good niche audience. Especially newly diagnosed diabetics or parents of kids who have just been diagnosed. Anyone who experiences how much of an upheaval on their life it is will understand."

First time here. I sincerely pray the doctors and scientists find a decent cure for both diabetes types. 

I’m not sure what is the proper etiquette but I wanted to learn more about Type 1 diabetes. I am writing a novel where my male protagonist has Type 1 since he was 10. He is 25 now. I wanted to do an accurate portrayal. Everyone in my family has Type 2 and as per my Google research, there are many differences between both of these. I can’t get help from family. 

Google has so much information but I need anecdotal evidence for my story as well.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Question 1: What happens when your sugar drops too much when you’re driving? How bad can it get without needing to go to the hospital? 

Question 2: can you have ice cream?

Question 3: how many insulin injections do you normally take (bolus vs basal)? Is it on the arms or stomach or thigh?

Question 4: anything you’d like me to know to make my character true? Things people might not normally know. Biggest challenge being Type 1.

Then wait 15 minutes, check your blood sugar again, and take more if needed, repeat. But most people carry snacks other than the noy-tasty glucose tabs. I stock up on those little packs of nerds every Halloween. Each box is about 12g of carbs.  Some people carry juice boxes, smarties, Skittles, frosting, basically anything close to pure sugar that can be taken and absorbed quickly and is a known quantity of sugar.
We are all different. Our lows are different. I have been as low as 20, but never passed out or lost full control like I've seen others do. I used to get tunnel vision at 50. Now, I can be at 50 for 15 minutes before realizing it unless my CGM is feeling accurate that day and already told me.
I eat low carb - I'm eating Rebel ice cream right now, but won't eat real sugar-loaded ice cream because trying to get the dosing right will ruin my night.
I take 1 basal shot of Tresiba every 24 hours, and 1-5 bolus shots with meals daily, depending on what I eat.  Usually just 1-2 per day though. A glass of whiskey with dinner usually negates the need for a dinner shot.
I have a CGM, but still check via fingersticks often because I'm lucky if the CGM is accurate a full 7 days in a row (out of the 10 it's supposed to last)"

I do have one bump though that I think is from a cgm but of years of wearing I can’t complain. Gotten worse scars from my cats. 

Pump supplies can be expensive. Depends on insurance so some may choose shots because of price. For T1s pumps are considered best practice. Most work with a cgm and can adjust basal insulin rates to help keep blood sugar more level. 

Activity is always an issue. The aim is a bs of 100 you are considered getting low or low at 70. So if you have decent control it doesn’t take much activity to drop 30 pts especially if you still have insulin on board. I am not a runner but those who do probably start their run with a high bs and carry gels to make distance. Wouldn’t be surprised if they have a go to after run drink to up their bs too. I know I always keep juice at home as a quick sugar fix when I don’t feel like eating."

I have done both, pump for a cumulative 11 years - but I'm better with injections and a CGM. The trade off? I might be more scheduled and I always have long acting insulin in the background, which will make you a *little* more prone to hypoglycemia during exercise. Depending on my starting bg, I'll need to fuel my exercise with 15g of carbs for every ~30-45min increment. Otherwise, shots are what work for me! 


I find a CGM is both invaluable and not a big burden to wear vs pumping which in my experience was prone to failure (kinked infusion sites, infected or irritated sites, other technical failures). I felt chained to my pump, literally and metaphorically. I feel in the dark without my CGM. 


Money/insurance coverage absolutely matter for this though. Both pumps and cgms can break the bank. I'm still paying off CGM debt from when I had worse insurance that didn't cover durable medical equipment (DME), but I'll take the debt over the lack of continuous glucose readings."

Type 1 Diabetic Story Character. Need Help for Research Purposes,"Hi guys,

First time here. I sincerely pray the doctors and scientists find a decent cure for both diabetes types. 

I’m not sure what is the proper etiquette but I wanted to learn more about Type 1 diabetes. I am writing a novel where my male protagonist has Type 1 since he was 10. He is 25 now. I wanted to do an accurate portrayal. Everyone in my family has Type 2 and as per my Google research, there are many differences between both of these. I can’t get help from family. 

Google has so much information but I need anecdotal evidence for my story as well.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Now that being said- a couple things strike me concerned in your post. When you say you’re carrying her to the hospital- how often is this happening? Same with bringing her juice? I’m concerned that your fiancé is going super low a lot based off this. For a mild low, she should be able to get herself a juice if necessary(if you’re just being nice that’s awesome!) In the 18 years I’ve been type 1- I’ve never actually needed to go to the ER for diabetes besides my initial diagnosis so if she’s having that urgent of lows- she might need to look at adjusting her doses."

You are at an aquarium with your fiancée. You're having a great time. Then all of a sudden you are separated by glass. You are standing in a tank and it is quickly filling with water. You are confused because you were right there with her a moment ago. You start to panic because you don't see a way out. You try to get her attention but she is still talking about the sharks you saw. You finally get her attention but she is asking you questions about how you got in the tank. You don't care how. You just want out. The water is now above your head and your trying desperately to tread water. You can barely hear your fiancee but she seems angry that you are swimming in a tank. You know you need to reach the top of the tank and pull yourself out but you are quickly losing energy. You aren't sure that you will make it. You might die in here. Why isn't your fiancee helping you? You know she isn't strong enough to pull you out but there has to be something! You just want to live! 

Lows hit us all differently but the panic is real. Our bodies feel like we are dying and we can't think straight to calm ourselves down. It's adrenaline on overdrive. There is no excuse for cruelty when we are in the throws or it but it's really hard to not lash out.

This is an experience from someone in a similar situation as you. I hope it helps.

Not a T1. Boyfriend is. I have been with him going on 8 years. He is the one for me. That being said, the lows (and highs) suck. Highs = moody and snippy till corrected. This is due to how he describes feeling like his nerves are on fire (I can’t imagine so I just be patient till it passes and assist if possible). Lows have a variety. He has been silly, non-coherent, sweaty, hot, angry, pissed, lethargic, punched (no energy behind it - he was close to passing out), he has had to ask me my name and who I was, he has insulted me, I have alerted him to lows he hasn’t caught. 

These are some examples off the top of my head. If I were to try to ask him to control his reactions/emotions it would be unrealistic. The reality is I have had to learned to control my reactions and emotions after the hurtful occurrences. Every single time without fail he apologizes. Every single time without fail I tell him he has nothing to apologize for. It’s not his fault (usually, he doesn’t let himself go ‘low’ through neglect) and he got dealt a shitty hand in life with T1. I signed up for this by being with him.

So, sorry for the long response. This is an experience from someone in a similar situation as you. I hope it helps."

That’s an overly simplistic look at what’s going on.  start to read more research papers or talk to someone who works in a field related to diabetes and how it effects the brain.

Asking her to control her emotions during a low is just rude, ignorant and being a straight up asshole. Diabetes is something that can, at times, be all consuming and reduce the control you have for yourself. Be it physically or emotionally.

I completely understand your skepticism and it is well-placed because you’re being treated poorly by your partner, unfairly, and that can feel terrible. You’ve already received some great answers in the thread so I will say that it just comes down to our brains’ malfunctioning due to severely low glucose levels. It is somewhat uncontrollable, with the loss of control sharply increasing as the episode gets worse. 

Our physical symptoms feel terrible (sweating, vision loss, erratic heart rate) and steal cognitive function. 

I always feel bad about the bad things I say to my wife in the rare instance a severe low causes me to lash out and I apologize of course when my blood sugar returns to normal. Some other Type 1s may have it much worse than I do and your partner may be one of them. Thanks for taking care of them."

Your inhibitions are lowered and you aren’t always thinking clearly or rationally. Your body is telling you to eat everything in the kitchen NOW in order to get that BG back up, but if you do, then you skyrocket too high and have to take insulin to correct BG and it can lead to spending hours getting off the BG rollercoaster. Your body is literally in survival mode. So even though it seems like she should be able to ‘control her anger and attitude’, give her some grace. Most of the time, quick-acting sugar takes about 15 minutes to hit. So get her some sugar if she asks for it, wait 15 minutes, and reassess. Out-of-whack BG is hard on the brain and the body. Too high or too low. Give some grace."

Many type 1’s have been arrested for being drunk & disorderly because of their behaviour & sadly there are cases where they have died in custody because they were left to ‘sleep it off’ instead of being treated. Very often they hadn’t even had a drink at all. I become either very emotional & I’m literally think everyone trying to help is actually trying to kill me (genuinely) or I become violent; I’ve even fought & punched a paramedic once when I had a very bad one whilst pregnant. Luckily they just laughed it off & said don’t worry it’s perfectly normal with hypos we get it all the time. 

In the immediate aftermath of a hypo she’ll be feeling like crap; it’s called a hypo hangover & probably embarrassed that it happened & angry with herself for letting it happen & embarrassed at how she behaved & frustrated she has this condition that can make her behave/feel like this. 

My hubby of 32yrs puts it perfectly when I apologise the next day - that wasn’t you that was diabetes I was talking to.

The best way to describe it is like being drunk where you're kinda wobbly and you can't streamline your thoughts properly.

I think it's important to talk to your partner not about how they act while they're low, but how they do after. Something similar to how you dont expect your drunk friend to act normal, but in their hangover the next day they thank you. 

It's reasonable for her to say it's uncontrollable, but it's unreasonable for her to not give you the appreciation you deserve after taking care of her, or even invalidating your feelings. I had a talk about this with my partner too and we learned to treat lows like, ""fix now, talk later"" kinda deal. Whatever I do or say while I'm low, we'll talk about after when I'm in my right mindset and thank/apologies to her when needed.

You SEE us doing things, but what you are seeing is just a tip of iceberg and usually you don't understand just how much mental effort goes into it all. You see me giving insulin, but what went on before was I took into consideration activity I did in last 24hrs, activity I plan on doing in next 4-5 hrs, approximate amount of carbs, but then adjusted that for speed because of fat, adjusted for type of carbohydrate I am eating because rice is not same as potatoes, then took into acount what my graph looked like for last 2 hours because it matters if I was going up or down, and what my graph looked around same time for last two days... and then decided on dose... fully well knowing my body is anyway quite likely to decide ""fuck you"" and my dose being wrong anyway, even if I took all that into account.   


I can't just ignore my blood sugars for several hours. It's always there. If I wake up in middle of night, it's there. If I go for a walk, it's there. And no matter what I do, I still get lows and highs I couldn't have predicted, because there is 42+ factors that affect ones blood glucose at any given moment, and you can't know all of it."

I've spent years regretting things I've said or how I acted until I figured out that this works for me and my close friends never take it personally and know that during a low I can't have a coherent conversation or focus because of my physical reaction to low blood sugar. My X would tell himself, sometimes out loud that this is the diabetes talking and not me because he had difficulty separating it at times an especially in the beginning. We lived together and realising it was actually a medical reason for behaviour I couldn't control helped him to not take it personally and he could help and support me instead.
A little advice from a diabetic to you as the partner, don't judge someone with diabetes because unless this is happening to you, you will never completely understand. Listen to your partner, she is the only one who knows how HER diabetes works. We all have type 1 in common and there are things we share but in reality it's not the same for all of us. 

I suggest you check this page out. It's information about how to support someone with type 1 and it's also a great source of information about diabetes in general:

My husband understood, but he had a plan. Because when I am low and still conscious, I am usually a little snappy with him. So he was like, well let's start conditioning your behavior when you are conscious so that you don't fight me when you are unconscious.

We have been working on that. When I have awareness and I am low, I have been trying especially hard to be nice when he is checking on me.

As it seems you have already gotten many replies but I did want to include my experience with speaking to people while I’m low.

Just for some background I was in 8th grade and was in the nerd class who learned more science, math, computer science and physics. Every year we had 2 days a year that we stayed at school all day and would get assigned into groups of about 5-6 people. The day this happened I had already gone low (a bit above 55) 3 times and it was only 10:30 am. I was still shaking from my other lows and didn’t even notice it when I went REALLY low, until I did and by then it was too late. My sugars were 40 and I was shaking and sweating and everything was spinning and moving around and sounds were getting jumbled in my ears and I wasn’t breathing right and I was just feeling I like I was dying. Once I understood what was happening I was like oh crap I need to go lay down under the ac right now. Mind you we are 5 8th graders in a classroom with 2 9th graders that were supposed to help us with the project. I stop mid explaining the complicated part of our project because I had noticed that I started stuttering and then I started noticing my surroundings and my symptoms got a lot worse in seconds. I just told them I need to lay down and went to lay down on a table under the ac. Then one of my teammates (she thought she was a really close friend of mine and she would just do these crazy things all the time in really inappropriate times) came up to me and sat down in the chair at the table I was laying down on and went “aren’t you going to keep explaining this? You are the only one in the group who knows this and what you are doing is kind of waisting our time.” I told her as politely as I could that I can’t and to just give me a few minutes so she divided to sit down next to me and wave her arms in my face and start screaming “WAKE UP, WAKE UP, GUYS I THINK SHES DEAD, I THINK SHES DEAD” and I sat up and I yelled at her that this isn’t funny and she’s being an bitch and to get the fuck away from me and that I felt like I was dying and this is what she does and that she was the worst friend in the world and she was a terrible person and everyone just looked at me horrified. She still decided to sit next to me and start making sounds and breath heavily in my ear and I snapped at her again and she just replied with I can sit where I want and that’s when the 2 9th graders with us told her to get out and left me in the class with one of my friends that was with us in the project that I told to stay and she just sat next to me, did not make a peep and asked me every once in a while if I was feeling better. I am a person who hates confrontation and in a normal situation would have just gotten up and politely gone to the bathroom of something but I just couldn’t control it because my body was in absolute survival mode."

I can relate to that.

My kid can be awful when we're treating lows. We call it the hangers because she's so angry with us when she's low. We kind of... not ignore it, but just... let it slide because it's not the priority. We just focus on getting the sugars up as fast as possible and leaving her in peace until she's recovered enough for her to eat something small, usually tea and toast.

It might help to have a set routine for when she's low. Like an agreed amount of fast carbs, what kind of carbs she might need, depending on the low. Knowing what works best for her when she's in that state, and what helps her feel better once her blood sugars come back up.

We do something like this for my daughter because right now we do the majority of her diabetes management, but we're trying to ensure she gets her say and is involved in each step of her care, so she can learn to do it for herself as she grows.

Hope this helps."

My body literally stops digesting at all if my blood sugar hits 60mg/dl. So, on top of the fact that your executive function starts to shut off as your brain doesn't get enough sugar, you are at an even greater panic about impending death. I get very annoyed at people, even if they are trying to be helpful, and I am likely to snap at them. I also become very obstinate as my brain starts shutting down, determined to do the last activity I was planning to do when I stopped being able to process. One low I took 20+ fingersticks because that was what I was doing when I went too low, but pushed family away who were trying to get me to drink juice - my brain hadn't gotten that far. 

My best advice is to try to help your partner catch her lows earlier. My dexcom alarms are set at 80, and I treat my lows then, hoping to bring them up before I can't digest food. I would also recommend that she talk to her doctor about microdosing glucagon, especially if lows are common. I would be happy to provide more info if she is interested, but this is taking small amounts of glucagon in an injection to raise blood sugar instead of using food. 

Try to imagine being drunk and horribly sick at the same time. The world is kind of foggy and you can't really keep yourself from saying that stupid thing that just went through your brain, all while feeling like you just want to curl up and die you feel so bad. This is sort of what it's like when you are really low. Your brain has no filter - you will say anything that pops into it. You also may not remember what you did or said when your blood sugar comes back up. If your blood sugar is low enough, your conscience mind shuts off entirely. You are then basically sleep walking, acting on that last thought you had before your brain shut down. Manners, tact, and politeness are not possible. Frustration and anger are more likely due to elevated hormone levels. The body is desperately trying to stay alive.

Years ago, I was going low while sleeping. It woke me up, and I headed to the kitchen to get a soda. By the time I reached the kitchen, I was no longer in my right mind. My parents found me several minutes later, slamming cupboards, grumbling about coworkers not properly stocking to-go cups. My frustration at my coworkers, while misplaced in this situation, was real-world frustration. My actions were nothing like I would have done at work if supplies were not available, though. This is the kind of thing that happens when you lose executive function. Because you are in a dream-like state, the frustrations and anger might have nothing to do with the current situation, and only a common thread - like a soda in this case. You have no control if you reach this state, and it can happen at different blood sugar levels depending on many factors. The only good solution is to try to prevent going this low.

That makes sense. Sorry hopefully I didn’t come off judgy with the low comment was just genuinely concerned if she’s having that bad of lows frequently.

I agree- I apologize if I’m ever a jerk but unfortunately in the moment, I’ve 100% been the jerk. It’s just such a mind numbing survival mode thing that we’re not always thinking clearly. Doesn’t excuse it and absolutely should say sorry if you say something mean but it does suck bad."

I said ok no problem and ran up to get it, got back and was like alright you ready and she flipped on me because I didn’t know she was low 🤷‍♂️ she stabilized her blood sugar, we talked about the situation and all I asked was for was communication. How am I supposed to check your blood sugar Everytime before I interact with you? I wish there was like some type of beacon over her head when she’s low so I know beforehand. It’s like having a girlfriend that has a period all of the time (as much as she’s low at least) for a really short period of time. It’s just another level of relationship when there’s a t1 involved"

I've had people think I'm faking it and just being an ass but I literally don't remember doing or saying things and we've all had this happen. I worked with a lady whose husband was a t1d and she was probably in her mid to late 50's and she asked me this same question and if he was lying or not. I then went on the educate and explain all of the things I've done but she still wouldn't listen to me she still thought he was faking it. (I think she didn't really like her husband and he wasn't very nice in general) I just don't understand why people don't believe us because we obviously have all been saying the same thing but she was older and didn't get on here and wouldn't educate herself. It boggled my mind why ask me the questions if you're not going to believe me? I appreciate that you are actually educating yourself I wish more people would do this. I always love it when partners come here to ask questions. 🩵

I totally feel for you and her. When my bloodsugar is off, and my husband is asking about it, I am just already pissed and frustrated about the bloodsugar, and  I feel bad physically, and I upset about him noticing, and it affecting him. It is a cascade of emotions that are hard to control because your body is short-circuiting.

If it is possible, have a talk with her when she isn't low or high and say something like ""I just want to help, I am not judging you or blaming you, we are in this together."" Like my husband said this to me, and I was just like, yeah he is right, he is my teammate and teammates need to work together. It won't happen right away because lows wreak havoc on the body and mind, but just try to be patient and remind her that you are her teammate, you are on the same team."

Um I'm an adult and been doing this for 28 years so get out of my diet. I might be eating that candy bar because I'm low plus again I'm an adult but people think it's their place. I have seen some responses that I find odd. There was a post someone put up that said they drink a ton of cherry mountain dew and it's not sugar free. I haven't had a regular coke since I was 10 unless I'm low and have no juice. That person blew my mind and he was responding to comments where people were saying you're insane for doing that AND eating pizza because pizza is an issue when we eat it and we always get high after but pizza. I have my Dexcom set to go off at 80 so I can try to prevent lows but it doesn't always work. I probably have crazy alarm settings but I'm trying to keep my a1c where it needs to me.

They tend to treat this like T2 at first (even if properly diagnosed) and hold back on bolus insulin as long as possible. I personally don't understand this thinking, but I'm not a doctor, nor am I an expert on LADA. I suppose that in the long run they deem it safer to run a bit too high and completely eliminate the possibility of serious lows, especially as these diagnoses typically happen in individuals over 30. Since their bodies can and do produce insulin, just not enough for normal eating, a lower carb diet and some basal insulin can keep their blood sugars reasonably stable for months, years, or even a decade or longer, as their body continues to slowly kill off their islet cells."

But I noticed that that ratio only applies up to a certain point. Up to about 40g 1:8 is fine, 40-70g its more like 1:6. 70-110g 1:5. So maybe thats what they mean…? But to your point, you just have to properly dose for it."

🇯🇲",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14rf8tc/whats_your_favourite_thing_to_eat_as_a_diabetic/,"Type 2 meds don't typically help traditional T1 unless caught pretty early. If they had you on T2 meds without your ending up in the hospital in DKA, then they must have caught you before your body had a chance to kill off most of your islet cells. Yes, this can happen, especially if they catch your diabetes in routine blood sugar screening and not because you are symptomatic, but it is far more likely for this to occur with LADA (basically slow onset T1), where the immune system slowly kills off the islet cells rather than typical T1 where it happens rapidly. LADA is considered T1.5, but for all practical purposes, it is T1, and once the islet cells have all been killed, it is exactly the same as T1. It does take weeks or even months for a T1 to go from normal to full-blown diabetes (this can stretch to years or even a decade for LADA - which is why T2 meds are effective for quite a while), but 6 weeks on T2 meds is a long time. I hope you did not end up horribly ill because they failed to treat you!"

As soon as they came back to my GP he called me to go straight to the emergency unit to get insulin where they kept me for 4 days 
It was only my fitness regime and healthy eating which masked the T1D symptoms although I had them all back in August and a hba1c of 64mmol but this was not passed to my GP till April.
They assumed my symptoms were related to the antihistamines I was taking for chronic idiopathic urticaria and angioedema which is a symptom of type 1 where the immune system is broken 
No LADA just plain old type 1"

🇯🇲",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14rf8tc/whats_your_favourite_thing_to_eat_as_a_diabetic/,"It sounds like you were lucky the consequences of delayed treatment were not much worse. Most adults who are diagnosed have LADA (true T1 diagnosis is rare in adults over 30), which gives doctors more leeway in getting test results back and deciding a course of action. For all practical purposes, LADA is T1 (though LADA may also show some signs of T2 not typically present in childhood onset T1, such as insulin resistanceand possible hypertigliceridemia), but currently, this diagnosis requires a patient to not need insulin to manage sugars for 6 months or longer. This requirement is still being debated, and some argue that LADA is T1 while others argue they have separate pathologies and are 2 different diseases (like T1 and T2 are different). Today, about 40% of LADA and T1 diabetes in adults is misdiagnosed as T2, causing increased possibility of complications due to inappropriate treatment."

🇯🇲",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14rf8tc/whats_your_favourite_thing_to_eat_as_a_diabetic/,"I said you were lucky they got you the right treatment in time for you not to get horribly sick. I did not say you didn't have T1, just that most adult diagnoses are LADA. Statistically, adult diagnoses presenting with acute symptoms and needing insulin immediately are low, though 40% of T1/T1.5 diabetes is diagnosed in adults. If you were correctly diagnosed initially, they would have started you on insulin immediately, but your doctor did run the correct tests right away to get a true diagnosis; many adults are not that lucky. Unfortunately, age is one of the primary factors they use in diagnosis, despite a large percentage of T1/T1.5 diabetes occurring in adulthood. I am really surprised that you lasted on T2 meds for 6 weeks, especially as it sounds like your earliest symptoms appeared even sooner. I was only symptomatic for a week before diagnosis, and I was very lucky that my mom recognized the symptoms and asked my doctor to check for diabetes. I didn't go through the horror most patients did in that era (1990), where losing 50 lbs and being deathly ill before diagnosis was still common. I was my pediatrician's first diabetic, so it would have taken him time to put the symptoms together without the push from my mom.

I am glad your doctor was able to get you proper treatment before you got sicker than you were. No amount of physical training or proper eating can protect you for long against your immune system destroying all the insulin producing beta cells."

I'm considered morbidly obese since having kids, I've never been able to lose weight which has caused insulin resistance. My blood pressure is high due to the weight. Those are my big problems and I just found out that I've probably been severely iron deficient for at least 5 years which doesn't help with many of my issues. I kept asking my Dr to check my iron amd was told I was fine, he didn't need to check. Ugh, freaking military drs.

I did the whole food plant based vegan and it was so much better than that but still more restrictive on the fat.

From what my Endo has told me studies show your chances of complications while staying 80% and above are pretty much non existent. You're aiming way too high and stressing yourself out. 

I'm 86% right now with 4% lows. My Endo loves my ass. She's more concerned about the lows than getting to 90%. 

&#x200B;

Let's be 100% real here. I like to drink too. Alcohol addiction will kill you. If we want to talk about what is worse for you it's not even close. Staying at 75% in range will cause significantly less damage to your body than alcoholism. 

This is not a good trade-off. Talk to a therapist. Talk to your Endo about burnout stress trying to get to 90%. 

It might also help to stay off of diabetes socials. They kind of cause some misrepresentations and higher than normal standards. You might think everyone should be at 95% because of the socials."

My mother is an alcoholic who recently has been diagnosed with a lot of health complications - that gave me the drive to stop. Cold turkey. We’re already diabetic and pouring poison into our bloodstream isn’t going to help anything. There’s no “safe” amount of alcohol. I’ve been sober for 5 months and can say I don’t miss it at all. It was hard to quit but i just kept reminding myself that drinking is only killing me quicker. I will note that the hardest part was that my sugars initially went through the roof. I had to adjust my long acting insulin up by almost 50% since my liver was now processing the food I was eating and not just the alcohol I was drinking. I do HIGHLY recommend therapy - I didn’t feel I needed it to quit but it helps other immensely. I wound up seeking therapy a month or so ago and it’s really worth looking into.

Using alcohol or any substance to cope with that is unhealthy and can cause many serious consequences. There's nothing wrong in enjoying a glass of something but if you need that glass everyday, it's not a coping mechanism anymore but indicates addiction.
You should talk to someone about this and find ways to cope that doesn't include substance use. You can talk to a therapist who specialises in trauma because a life changing diagnosis can be exactly that and personally I've also found great help in group therapy. 
It can take time to accept and adjust but it's not impossible. Please look after yourself and try to deal with this life change in more ways that the food you eat, the mental health part is incredibly important too.

Take care."

But you also find getting to 95% too stressful. That means you'll never be happy with it. You gotta find your happy medium. 

Always better to have the mentality that diabetes is day to day. You have a terrible day. Just move on. Use what you learned in the previous day to get better results today. Every day is a new chance. It's fine to have fail days. Fail days give you the chance to test the extremes. I ate funnel cake with my daughter for her birthday. I got blasted straight to 350 cause the insulin didn't catch on time. I don't regret it. It was a fun thing to do at the amusement park.  

A lot of times we fail to see the bigger picture. I don't know your age. But you most likely have time. Your life is 80 years. Don't be stressing about every little error. Most people in their 20s and even 30s are making mistakes. Living their lives. 

Dealing with Endos is hard too. Let it roll off your shoulders and move on. I made a kind of mantra for myself. ""Don't take it personal. They are on my side."" I repeat it before the appointment starts."

I have a medical alert tattoo. I have never ""needed it,"" and some people go as far as to say ""paramedics aren't trained to identify tattoos"" but I have talked to local paramedics who wouldn't ignore the tat if they saw it, which is why it is where I would wear a bracelet and is easy to read. 

Now I have more diagnoses than just diabetes, so they way I see it, the medical alert tat just lets them know they need to seek out my medical records if I am brought to the hospital."

I only wear it when I’m traveling alone because my closest colleagues and friends and family all know about my diabetes (and where the baqsimi is). Also from Etsy, I have these red resin tags that say “diabetic”, one’s on my set of keys for the car, one’s on my big medical bag for travel, and one’s on the hip bag I wear when I walk my dogs - because in those situations, if I were having a medical emergency I might not be near anyone trained to look for a medical alert necklace. 

The firehouse EMTs that took me to the ER before I knew I was diabetic did test my sugar in the van but they also did think I was over dosing before the blood sugar check. When I visited them afterward, and I flashed a shiny new CGM, he immediately recognized it and said “oh, you’re diabetic”. So if they see the equipment, the EMTs are aware, but if you’re well covered up, medical alert couldn’t hurt, and in all likelihood they are going to stick your finger either way. 

If you do wear one, I think having allergies on there is helpful if there’s space. I’m allergic to several common medications and food additives and if I’m unconscious I wouldn’t be able to tell anyone before they put me on something that could worsen my condition."

emts reslly going to ignore a tattoo someone spent 3k on that says their diabetic? or a brackette that says ""type 1 diabetic"" because the symbol isnt there? or is common sense really that uncommon tbst most emts wouldn't be smart enough to figure it out without precise rules? ie:has to have symbol, cant be a tattoo,"

"Tandem and Dexcom, we have to do something about the alerts","TLDR; 3 alerts if my BS hits 200 (pump, tandem app, and Dexcom app). THREE MINUTES LATER 3 more alerts for up-ing my basil rate. This scenario occurs for 2 people in the house! Please address this.

OK, so I have been a T1 since 1984. I've been on a tandem pump and dexcom for about 12 years. My pump and Dexcom, notify me of a high BS at 200mg/dl. At this time, I have to both unlock my phone and navigate to the Dexcom app to snooze the alert. Then I have to pull out my pump, unlock it and tell it I acknowledge the alert. THREE MINUTES after I have to snooze my pump (and mobile), I get ANOTHER notification on my pump (and mobile) that my pump has increased the basil rate since it's high. Which means I have to unlock my phone an open the Dexcom app, and then pull out my pump to snooze both devices (Tandem app doesn't cancel alerts on my pump, why do I have this app if I have to pull out my pump anyways?)

Since I have all my notifications turned off (except emergencies), I am not sure why I am getting beeped at by 2 devices in the first place (pump and mobile: did I mention that BOTH the Dexcom and Tandem app notify me?). But it's super annoying to have to do this each and every time it occurs.

Now, I have a 12 year old who was diagnosed 4 years ago. They also have a Tandem and Dexcom combination, as well as a mobile device. Do you see where I am going with this? The freaking beeping from our pumps and dexcoms are really infuriating. 

My control is good, I am happy with my a1c (6.5), but I still have these spikes every couple of days.

Notification fatigue is real. I can barely contain myself when I hear my pump chirp at me, so I snooze it, only to have it chirp at me the a second time to tell me something that could have been included in the first beep, 3 minutes apart from each other. Then add in I can hear my kids devices from anywhere in the house.

We'll get into the UI of the tandem app soon enough. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14rlnxv/tandem_and_dexcom_we_have_to_do_something_about/,"Was going to post something similar.  I got my limit with alarms across my Apple Watch and iPhone - quadruple alarms when using bothe the Dexcom and Tandem app. A few weeks ago, I literally threw my watch across the room after I got a couple of dozen alarms across just a few minutes.  

The absolute biggest issue is that Tandem alarms can not be dismissed from their app.  You must pull your pump out and dismiss it there, after likely dismissing the alert on your watch and phone.  

Second issue is duplication of alarms between rhe Dexcom and Tandem apps.   I don’t need to apps telling me I might need to eat carbs.  

And then there’s the 3rd issue: Dexcom’s watch complication is rarely up-to-date, and the Tandem app doesn’t even off a complication. My watch is useless for helping me outside of using the Sugarmate method of hacking your calendar.  Grrrr. 

Here’s where I ended up after I questioned how much value the alarms gave me:

* turned off all notifications for the Dexcom app. Unfortunately, this means you can’t use the app any longer for anything beyond capturing data for offline analysis. It disables itself if critical alerts are turned off.  At least I don’t get duplicate alerts between apps now.  
* turned off all watch notifications.  Sucks, but until I can completely dismiss alerts from the watch, I’m simply going to avoid notifications there. 
* t:connect notifications are allowed, except I turned off rise and fall alerts, and other alerts have repeat turned off. 

And, fwiw, I always use vibrate for alarms instead of beeps.  More discreet, and less irritating for those who live around me.  Urgent lows and highs are the exception.  This obviously doesn’t work for all other people, though. Works for me at least. 


Been much better for me once I set that up."

Why do I have to unlock my phone? I can cancel the alert, but it'll beep at me yet again. 

Why can't I snooze from my home screen?  

Why can't I snooze from my Tandem app? 

Why are the alerts 3 minutes apart telling me mostly the same thing (I mean, yes I can see my BS is getting high and I would expect my pump to bolus more, you don't need to tell me). 

We'll get into the UI of the tandem app soon enough. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14rlnxv/tandem_and_dexcom_we_have_to_do_something_about/,"I could totally be doing something wrong, but even though I have all the notifications off on my pump and dexcom app. These markers are the limits that something changes on my device. They beep and chirp at me when these thresholds change."
"Tandem and Dexcom, we have to do something about the alerts","TLDR; 3 alerts if my BS hits 200 (pump, tandem app, and Dexcom app). THREE MINUTES LATER 3 more alerts for up-ing my basil rate. This scenario occurs for 2 people in the house! Please address this.

OK, so I have been a T1 since 1984. I've been on a tandem pump and dexcom for about 12 years. My pump and Dexcom, notify me of a high BS at 200mg/dl. At this time, I have to both unlock my phone and navigate to the Dexcom app to snooze the alert. Then I have to pull out my pump, unlock it and tell it I acknowledge the alert. THREE MINUTES after I have to snooze my pump (and mobile), I get ANOTHER notification on my pump (and mobile) that my pump has increased the basil rate since it's high. Which means I have to unlock my phone an open the Dexcom app, and then pull out my pump to snooze both devices (Tandem app doesn't cancel alerts on my pump, why do I have this app if I have to pull out my pump anyways?)

Since I have all my notifications turned off (except emergencies), I am not sure why I am getting beeped at by 2 devices in the first place (pump and mobile: did I mention that BOTH the Dexcom and Tandem app notify me?). But it's super annoying to have to do this each and every time it occurs.

Now, I have a 12 year old who was diagnosed 4 years ago. They also have a Tandem and Dexcom combination, as well as a mobile device. Do you see where I am going with this? The freaking beeping from our pumps and dexcoms are really infuriating. 

My control is good, I am happy with my a1c (6.5), but I still have these spikes every couple of days.

Notification fatigue is real. I can barely contain myself when I hear my pump chirp at me, so I snooze it, only to have it chirp at me the a second time to tell me something that could have been included in the first beep, 3 minutes apart from each other. Then add in I can hear my kids devices from anywhere in the house.

I just love seeing my Dexcom with my Diabetes tattoo ♥️ plus my healthy babies that every doctor said I could never have 💛💛💛,,https://i.redd.it/0pkhy9dsw1ab1.jpg,I was told that I couldn't have kids and here I am with my 13 year old birth control baby and I don't regret it at all he is the best kid in the world. Now my delivery wasn't the best because he was 10lb 13oz and 23in long when he was born and over extended my uterus but I fully recovered and am in good health and my a1c was 5.2 the whole time I was pregnant. So boooo to doctors that say this to scare us I get your a1c needs to be under control but come on.

I just love seeing my Dexcom with my Diabetes tattoo ♥️ plus my healthy babies that every doctor said I could never have 💛💛💛,,https://i.redd.it/0pkhy9dsw1ab1.jpg,"Thank you so much for this post. I was diagnosed when I was 27,.just as my boyfriend and I had started trying. We were told instantly to stop and have had the fear put into me about having children. I basically had my dream of being a mother ripped from me and I really haven't been coping. It's 3 years later and I'm approaching 30. Still trying to get my bloods to a range they said it would be possible, but every day I am making little mistakes here and there and it reminds me I'll likely never be a mum.

Seeing your post today has lightened the flame again.  May I ask if you found it difficult keeping your bloods in range for the whole pregnancy and leading up to it? Also, do you have any tips and tricks that helped keep everything steady? I'm at the point now where I just don't eat carbs if I can avoid it which is also really depressing."
I just love seeing my Dexcom with my Diabetes tattoo ♥️ plus my healthy babies that every doctor said I could never have 💛💛💛,,https://i.redd.it/0pkhy9dsw1ab1.jpg,"It was so weird for me when I actually got cgm and my blood sugars were good (a1c in low-mid 6s ever since I got libre, with very few lows and very few values over 240) and also at the same time learned chance of my kids having complications or having T1 is actually really low (I'm in my mid 30s) at those levels. I never even considered having kids before... and then I suddenly realized I could. And now I'm bit confused, cause I am not even sure I want to - and I should probably decide whether I want to within next 5 years lol. But I can if I want to - and that's kinda awesome!"
I just love seeing my Dexcom with my Diabetes tattoo ♥️ plus my healthy babies that every doctor said I could never have 💛💛💛,,https://i.redd.it/0pkhy9dsw1ab1.jpg,"I can't give you advice as a diabetic mom, I'm only the mother of a diabetic. But I do want to say something to you.

You CAN do this. You ARE capable. If your dream is to be a mother there is no reason you can not become one. You have time to figure it out and get it right. Adjust your doses and foods and whatever else you feel right adjusting. 

Please don't be too hard on yourself though. You are worthy and important and capable no matter how you become a mother, and no matter how many mistakes you make in the journey. 

Baby steps are still steps, and I dare anyone to find me a single person who made their dreams come true without making a single mistake. 

You got this! No matter what anyone else says, I believe in you."
I just love seeing my Dexcom with my Diabetes tattoo ♥️ plus my healthy babies that every doctor said I could never have 💛💛💛,,https://i.redd.it/0pkhy9dsw1ab1.jpg,"Someone already kind of replied what I was going to say and said it perfectly - Neither of my pregnancies were perfect and they were both “unplanned”. I did the best I could and was able to stabilize my sugars bringing my a1c under 8 both times (which at the time was a huge accomplishment for me). 

It’s not about cutting carbs it’s about balance.. at least in my experience. Doctors really focus on scaring us for some reason but honestly think of all the women who don’t have any chronic illness or pre-existing conditions - so many have complicated pregnancies. My mom was perfectly healthy and she had a baby who then became type 1 diabetic… I just say this to say we never know what will happen. There’s no reason you shouldn’t try to make this dream of children come true - just pay attention and do the best you can. 

Both pregnancies had complications but we made it through. You can too - there’s no guarantees for any of us so hope for the best and prepare for the wild ride of it all!"

There’s so much talk about what can go wrong and so much judgement if you’re not perfect. This disease is fucking difficult!! It’s never the same for each person and our bodies all react so differently to food, medicine, activity, etc… I’ve had to fight hard and really really advocate for myself to get proper care and even to find a doctor who listened to me. Of course it’s much better to be perfectly in range but there’s zero guarantee your children will be affected at all. Nobody in my family for many many generations has had diabetes then boom I’m diagnosed at 9 years old. I’m so glad you feel that sense of freedom now (no matter what you decide) and keep up the great work 💛"

It gave me a welcome giggle. Your message means the world to me so thank you for taking the time to write out a response.

I think it's something I keep trying to remind myself, that I'm only human and will make little mistakes here and there. It's just so hard when for example you wake up and the first thing you do is scan your arm and BAM, your bloods are at 15mmol and you immediately feel like a failure. It does come in waves and as you say if I am determined enough then I will get it done. 

Thanks again so much for your kind words I know I can be a tenacious little monster when I put my mind to it. I think though it is sometimes hard to find that side of me, she is in there somewhere and I think your comment has spurred her on a little. 

I bet you're a magical mamma and I'm so pleased your child has someone so wonderful helping them navigate a life of diabetes. Best of luck and every bit of happiness to you and your family."

My a1c was never over 8.5 so no clue why they were so pissy - yeah, high 7s are not perfect a1c, but it ain't ""dying by 30"" level either (I have had some retinopathy in my 20s after few years of not giving a fuck, but otherwise no complications so far). I now live in Korea, where T1s make up less than 1% of diabetics and I know doctors have zero clue and if I do decide to have kids, I'm completely on my own with my care (I'm on my own now anyway). Should have became medical doctor and not doctor of science, but ey, am doctor in name so might as well be my own doctor I guess xDDD"

And thank you for your kind words. There are definitely a lot of moments where I feel like a failure, tonight alone is one of those hellish diabetes nights. Sometimes it doesn't matter what you do, T1 just had a mind of its own, that mixed with a dexcom sensor that has decided to be an A hole and a kid who just wants to sleep just makes a Trifecta of insanity lol. 

We use the mg/dl calculations, so I'm not sure what 15mmol is on that scale, but I do know some days can absolutely feel so frustrating and impossible. I think you are truly inspiring for facing such a frustrating disorder with hope and determination when there are so many people who just accept defeat and give up. That takes incredible courage and character. 

I fully believe that those traits will make you an incredible mother, and this struggle now will make your future even more amazing because you will be able to look back and see why it was all worth it. 

I wish you all the luck and happiness to you and yours as well."

If it was denied because you don't meet their criteria (likely due to lack of T2DM) the only thing your doctor could try would be a peer to peer.

Call dexcom. Find out what the procedure and requirements are. Ask when you should give up on it. They should have no problem replacing a bad sensor

How do i fix it? Is anyone else having issues with it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14quuk9/i_hate_the_g7/,"Yeah thats a sensor error. Id stop it and put in the next before reaching out to dexcom and they'll ship you a replacement. Unfortunately the g7 is newer so there are still kinks they are working out. Im on my 8th now and have already had 2 faulty ones (one cut out three days early after having constant brief sensor issue errors, and the next didnt even make it 5 hours before shutting down.) 

My views are it has potential if they can get these worked out (and gwt their app to calm down on alerts)."

Intermittent fasting and diabetes,"I have T1D and while intermittent fasting at 20:4 I only need to take basal of like 5 units. 

My concerns are that this low amount of insulin in my system could cause DKA.

I have hear that you can have stable blood sugars and still get DKA if you go for long periods of time without taking insulin or when taking very little.

The reason I am worried is cause I see a bunch of people in the same boat as my and they are taking like 19 basal so I wonder what the threshold of too little insulin is.

Also, I just kinda jumped into intermittent fasting at 20:4 3 days ago and have been feeling great but all of a sudden today I felt very sick and out of breath. I quickly did insulin, ate and am feeling better now.

Would love some advice :)

I noticed that DKA was a little easier to start fall into if I was sick or if I accidentally forgot a dose of insulin (like if I fell asleep at night on the couch and didn't wake up until the next morning and missed a shot). It was very easy to tell that I was slipping though, so I combatted it pretty fast by drinking a lot of fluid and then eating something carby to be able to give myself more insulin until the beginnings of the keotacidosis subsided (usually the rest of the day I'd make sure and eat carbs and give plenty of insulin).   
It sucks because it throws off your fasting and ketosis, but it's far better than going into DKA and it's also usually only for one day so it was easy for me to get back on track (especially since the food made me feel icky after not eating that way for so long.)  
These times were rare though. Maybe once every few months."

When I was diagnosed 8years ago they told me 14 units as basal and that worked back then.

Now, it varies which is very annoying. I think the main factor that causes it to vary is diet and exercise.

Some times if I have been inactive for 2 or 3 days I need to take more again. It's maddening cause that throws me into either high or lows at night depending on which direction it decides to change."

Fluttering heartbeat is the biggest one for me.  Nausea, fatigue, and just the feeling of being 'off', if that makes sense. I can tell instantly when I wake up if my body is headed that direction.   
Like I said though, it was really rare. I think it is easier to go into DKA though because there were already ketones present in my body because of my state of ketosis. :)"

Since it crept on so slowly & I (21F, at the time) had never had a severe low before, I didn't realize what was happening. I realized I was watching the show through one eye. I couldn't make any sense of the jokes.

Then I started to pass out & I faded in & out... it was like reality was being edited around me. One moment, the crowd's laughing - the next, they're sitting still. The comedian ended up doing some songs, which I still avoid listening to nearly 5 years later (as I feel nauseated hearing them)! Then another blackout & when I came to, the show was over & people were leaving.

I didn't have depth perception so I was trying to ""be cool"" by pretending to walk out of there like nothing was wrong but I blacked out again as soon as I got out onto the dark & rainy sidewalk.

The scariest was when her sugar kept declining even after treating her and we couldnt sleep the whole night. She wasnt willing to eat anything and even threw up once, when we forced her. What makes it worse? I had to catch a flight the next morning as I was going for an employment opportunity for at least a month and I so wanted to cancel the flight so I could be with her :(. 

Her glucose level stabilised the next morning and I ended up taking the flight. We abstained from giving her any insulin for the next 36 hours.

Thankfully, that has happened only once and she is back to normal."

I ended up pretty far away from my office (I think I was trying to drive to the ER but I'm not sure) and I passed out and ran off into a little ditch. People of course called 911 saying I was drunk but luckily a type 1 sheriff got to me first and he saw my glucagon and gave it to me. When my husband and mom got there they said I was pregnant so he didn't give me a ticket or have my license suspended. I was very lucky that he showed up (some cops have no clue about diabetics driving) and had an ambulance come to pick me up and my car was not damaged at all. I have never had that issue before or after but it was terrifying esp bc I was pregnant.

I woke up early randomly and heard my 6yo daughter moving in her room. I called to her but she didn’t answer. I went to check on her and she was seizing.  I checked her sugar (I know, wrong thing to do!) and it was 71.  So I thought she was having a stroke.  Didn’t even occur to me to give her glucagon (because 71). We called 911 and they carried her out.  We think her sugar dropped super low in her sleep and dawn phenomenon raised her sugar such that when I checked she was 71.  911 sent an ambulance without Paramedics so we had to meet another ambulance en route to actually help her.  (Even though I said it was a child with T1D, which should have triggered an advanced crew).  She was coming out of it by the time we got to the hospital but I was so worried she would have brain damage because of it.  Who knows how low and how long it was?!? The ED was suuuper reassuring (sarcasm) and said that “we won’t know until she starts showing deficits in school”.  Luckily, she seemed to have weathered it without a blip.  So so lucky."

Diabetes camp,"Hi, I’m a girl in middle school and a type one diabetic.
I’m going to a diabetic camp this summer and just have some questions that I haven’t seen anyone answer.
If you are interested in answering my questions please feel free to do so, I really do appreciate it.


Do they have access to my Dexcom and Omnipod?
Will they start messing with my basal?
Do they need the passcode to my PDM?
Will they bug me about my blood sugar?
Will they make me give insulin the way they see fit?


I know some of these are pretty extreme but these are just some of my worries that I really need to be reassured about.


If you did leave an answer to some of these questions or even finish this post, thank you and I appreciate you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14qljqd/diabetes_camp/,"I went to several different diabetes camps as a kid starting when I was 7 and ending when I was 16, both sleep away and day camp. All camps are different, but the idea of the camp is to take the pressure off of you in your management so that you can experience some freedom from the constant worry and stress. Everyone there is on a mission to let you have fun and freedom (not that you usually can’t, but this is a different level!) 

They’ll need to know your treatment plan, e.g. basal rates, correction factors, carb ratios) and will decide insulin you take, but will ask you questions to confirm whether their decisions make sense. You’ll meet with your counselor or a nurse at meal and snack times to plan insulin and carbs, etc. Their goal is to let you eat and play freely. They will not take your pump/PDM/pens/needles and administer insulin for you. They will consult you on what to do and then you will self administer insulin (if that is what you currently do. For younger kids they may administer the insulin). 

They will have eyes on your numbers like a hawk to make sure that you are safe and healthy. They may change your basal rate temporarily as you will likely be very active at camp and they don’t want you running low. My basals/long acting doses ALWAYS changed at camp. Camp is designed to give you autonomy, not take it away. 

I will say that I went to camp before CGMs were really a thing, so there were a million finger pricks. I’m not sure if they’ll have you provide a share code, but if they do it’ll be temporary just for camp. 

I adored diabetes camp and I don’t regret any single part of going. I would go back as an adult if adult diabetes camp existed! I am so excited for you but I understand your worries completely."

At Camp Sweeney for instance, they will make dosage changes based on activity levels. If they didn’t, you would be low the entire time! They will save the dosages you come in with, and change them back after camp. They will need access to your PDM password, which shouldn’t be an issue? I don’t know what you mean by bug you about your blood sugar, but they only treat the number - it’s not treated as a moral issue. Especially since they’re dosing you, so you wouldn’t be the one making insulin decisions anyways.

Other camps are more lenient. Some of them let you do the carb counts and discuss your meal dosages with you, depending on your age and maturity levels. No camps should be acting like your blood sugars are “your fault”. 

At all camps, there will be dosage changes. This is expected. They all have endocrinologists on site overseeing these changes and making decisions. It’s not something to worry about, I’m sure you’ll be in good hands."

The idea for the teenagers is building independence , for the young kids (under 10/11) there's a lot more supervision.


At meals etc everyone per cabin does their approximate dosing before hand (or during the meal since camp meals are fun chaos and singing too).

It's very much structured where the staff is there if you need them but not in your face, they mostly just chase you down with glucose tabs"

I think it depends on what type of diabetes camp it is exactly but I assume there is access to medical caretakers that might check your devices / your settings, but only in order to make reasonable changes. I am sure that they act professional and are not messing with your settings careless. People in those camps do have a lot of experience with t1 and often have diabetes themselves so I think you can expect that they won't ""bug"" you about your blood sugar. In the end I think you can learn a lot from them and it can help you to gain better control. They won't force you to do anything you are not comfortable with. I hope you have a great experience!"

The staff at the camp should prioritize your safety and well-being, so I would suggest discussing all your concerns with them beforehand.  

Regarding your Dexcom and Omnipod, they might have specific policies in place to ensure their proper use and maintenance. It's always a good idea to confirm this with the staff to ease any worries you may have. 
As for your basal, it's unlikely that they will make changes without your consent or the involvement of your healthcare team. It's essential to communicate your requirements and any adjustments that may be needed. 
It's possible that the camp may ask for the passcode to your PDM just as a precautionary measure, but it's best to confirm this with them directly. Your privacy should be respected, and any personal information should be kept confidential. 
The camp staff should be well-aware of the importance of monitoring blood sugar levels. While they may remind you to keep track, it's worth discussing how involved they will be in managing your blood sugars, and if they will cooperate with your usual routine. 
Remember, it's important to advocate for yourself and communicate your needs and preferences to the camp staff. If you have any further concerns or questions, feel free to reach out to them or even contact me via DM."

Will they start messing with my basal?
Do they need the passcode to my PDM?
Will they bug me about my blood sugar?
Will they make me give insulin the way they see fit?

It was one of my best memories and my first experience taking care of myself.

Back then it was pretty relaxed. I was on a pump and simply went to see the camp nurse if I started to go low or high and had daily check ins. 

I'm sure it's a bit more concentrated care now though, especially if it's a diabetics camp.

Honestly such a great experience. You'll love it."

It was a sleepaway camp about 1 to 2 weeks at a time. I believe the middle school level had two week options. This was way before CGMs and just the beginning of better insulin pumps so I can't say much to that. But when I was there they had an endocrinologist on staff, plus about four nurses that would rotate. A lot of the camp counselors were type 1 diabetics themselves. They definitely took all your history and your current dosages and whatnot and made changes based on food, activity, and anything else that might be affect blood sugars. We literally had a lineup everyday of people going in to a separate cabin to get their blood sugars tested, wait line to talk to the doctor, and they would give insulin dosage. And then we would go into the next room to get our shots! Food was doled out by a point-like system basically, but it was based around carb choices. So like if I wanted an English muffin, that would be two points essentially. Every single person that worked at the camp always carried around a bag with things to help with low blood sugars. We had a camper one year that ended up having a seizure from going too low and it was handled beautifully. This happened of course right as humalog started becoming a standard and everyone was learning just exactly how quick acting it was. 

Overall it was a really great time, and the one time of the year that for a week I was with people who had the same issue as me. I could get a real camp experience even with the extra work that goes into maintaining the health of type 1 diabetic children. 

I wish you all the best in your camp experience and hopefully you will have a fantastic time as well!"

I see your question has been answered, but i want to give my 2 cents.

I went to Camp Sweeney from 2002-2011. The alumni reunion was yesterday. Camp for me was amazing and my only wish is that i wish i would of went when i was younger.  starting going when i was 8M, currently 31M

You will meet friends that do last a lifetime and it's nice to have a place that knows you for a lifetime. 

You will be pushed out of your comfort zone and it's ok. You will do activities that are unique. Enjoy yourself.

Don't be worried. Your diabetes will be taken care of. You will most likely go low in your first 3 days there. Its ok. The camp has plenty of juice on standby for you when you will go low. 

Have fun."

I thought I would take a second to explain more in detail what I am most worried about so that it’s more clear since I feel that I wasn’t clear enough on my original post.
The thing that I am most worried about is other people making my insulin decisions, which I know might sound silly because who wouldn’t want to lose the responsibility even just for a few days. With that I feel that these people don’t personally know me and therefore couldn’t fully know how to dose my insulin just the way I know works for me. This isn’t an issue with the staff or anything of course, I think this is just a me thing that I cannot for the life of me let someone else that I don’t fully trust take care of my diabetes management."

As far as food dosages go, camps usually will not differentiate dosages for different “types” of carbs. If your ratio is 1u:6c for instance, you would get 5 units for 30 carbs regardless of what’s on the plate. If you then go high, they correct later. If you go low, they’ll treat the low ASAP. Some of them may provide a little leniency, it really just depends. The camp I counsel at might allow for small changes depending on the camper. The camp I went to as a kid though would not have allowed for any changes, and I actually wasn’t involved in any dosing decisions (even as a teen). So it will really depend. Just know in any case, the team is on top of changes. If they recognize you’re regularly high after lunch, they will up the insulin. If you’re regularly low at night, they will adjust the nighttime insulin or bedtime snack. While I do understand the frustrations that may come with camps that don’t allow you as much freedoms to make your own choices, I would encourage you to remember that camps are usually short in duration. Your control might not be as exact, and it’s a temporary thing. Guarantee you won’t be experiencing any long term issues from a camp experience. If you go to your camp and dislike the way they handle your insulin regime, you can always try another one or decide to not go in the future. I think it’s awesome you’re trying one out, and I hope it works for you :)"

resting ketones ?,"not really sure this is normal but its never happened to me before. my ketones for the past few days have been resting at around 0.5 when they're usually 0. they spiked the other day up to around 0.8, maybe even 1 (i couldn't check the specifics).

the usual things to sort them aren't bringing them down so i'm just feeling a bit tired and sick all the time. anyone else had this issue before?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14r5nvd/resting_ketones/,"Ketones rise and fall daily, producing low to medium levels of ketones is very normal. Our body produces ketones when we burn fat for fuel, so it would be expected to have low to moderate levels first thing in the morning as we haven't eaten since the night before. This would be expected in non-diabetics as well as T1. 

T1 diabetics get concerned about ketones when we either don't have insulin or are not taking enough. If we are sick it is always a good idea to check ketone levels and take insulin and hydrate to reduce if they are on the medium to high side. 

Low levels like you describe should not really cause any level of sickness. There is a chance that the sick feeling you have is entirely separate from diabetes. I'd recommend eating some carbs, taking your bolus insulin as normal and staying hydrated."

While FDA approval did come, I've noticed with docs (for other conditions), they are not good on prescribing new medications, etc. that are just on the market.
Your doc probably does not have a lot of experience since it is probably going through insurance vetting process, and insurance companies are always a bit behind the curve when it comes to new therapies."

I'm sure it resulted in extra work for Endo offices - extra paperwork, taking calls to help locate pharmacies with stock, etc, and just generally dealing with patients who are learning a new system.  At my son's last Endo appointment, I witnessed parents having a massive breakdown trying to figure out how the system worked (I heard they'd left and came back within a couple of hours).

Anyways, I can see reasons why a practice wouldn't want to prescribe new technology immediately, and it may be worth the wait for you as well."

Thanks :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14qfk8i/my_type_1_bf_wants_a_tattoo_and_his_mum_is_very/,"I have a lot of tattoos. Most of them were done in my 20s when I had abiymal control (12+ a1c). Basically a lot of little/medium tattoos to form oldschool sleeves, and on top of my feet. I healed with no issues, though I was very conscious of healing. I still regularly get tattoos with my lower a1c (low 6s) and the only thing I would say is the heal time is longer, even with good control. Usually artist say it takes 2 weeks to heal, for me it is almost double. My husband (non diabetic) and I got tattoo'd in Vegas last year and he did absolutely everything WRONG to take care of a tattoo and healed in two weeks. I was very cautious and took care of mine and it took 4 weeks. So just keep that in mind. 

He should go to a reputable shop, keep it clean and go to the doctor ASAP if it looks infected, but it really should be fine. Also make sure to bring low snacks to the appointment! No fun getting a low while getting tattoos, but I find the tattooing keeps my levels elevated a bit due to the stress."

Make sure he eats good before going and keep snacks and his CGM/meter handy. But getting tattooed is really nothing special in regards to its impact on glucose. Make sure he lets his artist know beforehand - and they will ask about medical conditions on his paperwork too.

I’ve never had an issue, and most artists keep some candies at their stations too, or at least mine have. They’ll take breaks if he needs as well.

Good luck!"

His immune system isn't that bad unless he's on a bad bg streak or has complications, and his sugars wont drop unless he's unprepared.   


Got my tattoo on my arm. Took about 30-45minutes. I had absolutely no troubles with it or with the healing afterwards. Sugars didn't budge because I was sitting down the whole time, tattoo healed up great in the amount of time it was predicted to.   


Only advice is to be aware some places won't want to tattoo t1ds for various reasons, so everyone at the appointment should know that he is one and the situation should be comfortable for everyone involved!"

I’ve had short session & very long ones. Had them when my HBA1c was high had them when it’s been normal - not noticed a difference when healing with either! 

My tips - make sure he drinks plenty for the few weeks leading up to it (useful tip for anyone getting a tatt) makes the skin more hydrated & easier to work. 

On the day as others have said; good breakfast then take snacks & drinks with you (again standard for anyone having a tatt)

Don’t panic if his sugars go high - perfectly normal adrenaline reaction; they will come down of their own accord. 

Listen to the tattooist for cream & healing tips (so much has changed over the years - again nothing to do with type 1 just they have more knowledge!)

Make sure the artist knows he’s a type 1 - it helps them too. 

Don’t worry when he starts planning his next one (we all know how addictive they are!)

He’ll be able to place his cgm or flashgm or pump on top of tattoos - I’d struggle to find a clean piece of skin to use mine!!!! My Libre works perfectly well sitting on top of my tattoos & always has. 

Make sure he keeps it clean after!!!! (Again another one for anyone getting tattoos)

Most important one though!!!! Make sure you come back & show us the pics after!!!!"
My type 1 bf wants a tattoo and his mum is very concerned,"Hi all, I was hoping a person with type 1 diabetes with tattoos could give me some advice.

I usually do let the tattoo artist know and I monitor my blood sugar periodically throughout the session. I’ve not experienced a dramatic drop, the only time it dipped was because it was a five hour session and we didn’t break for food, so as soon as I noticed it getting lower we took a snack break. I haven’t had many issues with healing either, that seems to go about as normal!"

I (type one) have gotten half my forearm done (approx 6h), and didn't experience a low. He should make sure he eats before the appointment and is hydrated. 

Another thing to note is that the healing process may take longer than usual. When I started getting tattooed, I was healing within the usual time frame. Now 5 years later, I find I take an extra week or two to finish the process."

. For the first 2 ish weeks after you just want to keep a tighter reign on sugars than usual as high blood sugars can make infections easier to develop and also slow healing. Also usually not a great idea to get tattoos done with a high A1c (think >11 or 12) because that means the control is not quite there, and to wait until the a1c has come down a bit first. But that's more so to promote healing and everything.

As long as his blood sugars are relatively under control (and I don't mean an a1c of 5 but just good checking and regulation of sugars) , the immune system aspect is mostly bull as long as you go to a reputable place and clean it well with unscented soap and lukewarm water after removing the cover (if he gets one)"

I have a half sleeve and a medic alert tattoo on my wrist. Feel free to check out my post history. Haven’t had any issues and I just made sure to clean my tats well and follow my artist’s advice

Edit: I feel like if it’s his first tattoo he should go in there and let the artist know. Just a simple “Hey, I’m a T1. I may need a break if I feel like I’m going low”. Artists generally ask if you need a break too if you go to a good place. So def make sure to check the reviews of the place you booked the appointment for. 

I did have some healing issues with the one on my wrist BUT it was because I scrubbed too hard. My artist said that it actually healed better than it should’ve based on the needle size she used for the feathers on my wrist tat. So my advice as a T1 is not to scrub AT ALL when washing the first 2-weeks with Softsoap. I irritated it and it scabbed up pretty bad but that was because I got cocky and was like, “I know what I’m doing” 🤦‍♀️"

Take some snacks with and tell the artist he may need a break if he has a low because eating in the chair isn't sanitary. I got a medical alert tattoo the year I was diagnosed and I also do my own at home with zero problems. Every doctor I have and so many nurses get excited when they see my medical alert tattoo and think it's an awesome thing got diabetics to do.

I've been sick with some kind of flu or other thing every year. Had covid twice. Never even needed urgent care or a doctor visit. It's down to the persons immune system. Maybe he's just had a weak immune system his whole life that his mom knows about ? You could easily test that by what you've experienced with him. The parts about blood going low and passing out make sense if a person has low sugar, but why would he get low sugar from getting a tattoo ? that doesn't make any sense. If anything that kinda stress would cause the liver to release glucose and raise his blood sugar."

Some people go low during sessions but I run really high. I adjust for that, and make sure I have a snack ready for when we finish and I drop from my IOB. 
Just let your artist know you might need little breaks here and there. And please go to someone good haha"

There were a few points throughout where i felt my sugar dipping, so I just asked for a quick break and checked it, then had alittle snack or something to boost it up. All of my tattoos have been 7+ hour sessions and I’ve managed with moderately controlled sugars. I just posted about this a few weeks back because my a1c was higher than usual this time around and I was unsure if I should get this tattoo i booked. Many had said that they had lots of tattoos done while in the 12-14 a1c range, and had no issues. Having higher sugars usually just prolongs healing time, which will cause issues if you don’t take care of your tattoo after words. He will be fine and will know what to do if anything happens during the session. :)"

It will be next to Vaseline and/or diaper rash/skin care in the baby aisle. Mad rabbit has a healing gel that helps with the first couple of days after if it hurts a lot. I prefer Aquaphor instead of the healing gel, but it’s basically an ointment that will keep it moisturized and promote healing. I do like mad rabbits lotions. They keep my ink looking fresh.

Was it a manual or algorithm pump? 

My personal experience were frequent hypos at night (resolved with the pump), and issues with exercise. I either had to lower my basal injection for a day with exercise and then run too high the rest of the day, or keep downing sugar to avoid lows if I wanted good levels the rest of the day. The pump resolved that too."

Now I’m on the Tandem with the steel cannulas. My favorite part about this system is how it backs off the basal if it projects a low so I hardly ever do go low and I hardly ever get woken in the night."

After having three-four site injection failures a month, having to throw away all the insulin inside another failed pod, calling into the company to get replacements and having to answer their 20 questions every time I finally got rid of the pump bullshit over a year ago after insurance told me it would be about $1500 every three months for the privilege. At least with the pens I know I’m getting every unit of insulin I inject, as opposed to the pump I used which could fail at any moment.

Also low key convinced Omnipod is a half baked product that is not fit for market. But that might just be me."

It makes me feel ashamed and othered to see people say that the pump and loop systems are “the answer” when it just doesn’t work for me. Am I not “doing diabetes right”? Is there something wrong with me that I simply hate the pump?

My sweaty pants and pod controller decided that I needed to bolus without my permission.,"Yesterday morning I was out doing yard work and after about an hour in I was drenched in sweat.

10th Diaversary,Hello fellow type 1 ds (and other diabetics). I’m usually passive on this subreddit. I just read other posts but…today is my 10th diabetic anniversary. I was diagnosed at 7 years old and this is the first year I’ve really paid any mind to the day or wanted to celebrate in some sarcastic capacity. I guess I just wanted to tell people who would get it. I’m the only one in my family and I know very few other diabetics (and we’re not close). Today. I’m not quite sure how I feel. I’m angry and sad and happy and a lot of other emotions I don’t quite know how to articulate. I’m pretty well controlled at this point in my life now but that doesn’t mean it’s always good. I’ve spent a good majority of the first years of my diagnosis feeling bad about EVERYTHING. Sometimes I still do. This diagnosis and living with diabetes for the past 10 years has changed so much of my life; both good and bad. I would love to hear other peoples experiences or emotions or any piece of your life advice at this point if you’d be willing to share. Anyways… thanks for listening and I appreciate you taking the time to read a very small point of my story.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14qpe79/10th_diaversary/,"10 is a big one! I just got 30 a month ago. Biggest thing I can say is just don't ever give up. Of course there are thousands of up and downs, just gotta roll with it and try to have more ups than downs. Be stubborn.

They don’t care that I highly reduced the amount of insulin I needed, that it helped stabilize my blood sugars, or any other parts that it helped me. 

Most insurances I’ve been on also won’t cover it as a weight loss drug either because they don’t cover weight loss medications. 

I’ve been looking into prescription discount programs but most of them are still stupid high."

Dexcom: Two questions,"When you put on a new Dexcom and it bleeds, do you immediately take it off? I’ve read on here that some people will take it off right away, but I rarely get any sensors that don’t bleed, so that seems like such a waste even if you report them to Dexcom. 

And how long does your sensor hurt for after insertion? I just put a new one on and it’s tender, but it did bleed, plus it’s trauma to the site with a thin wire being shot into my skin, so I’m sure some pain is normal. When the sensors hurt during insertion, do you keep them on?

Am I better off being on medicaid?,"I'm currently on NY medicaid and everything from omnipods to dexcom sensors to test strips and insulin (as well as my psych meds) are %100 covered with no copay. The income threshold for cutting off medicaid here is around $1600 a month or $20,000 a year. If I get a job making like $25-35k a year will I actually get a lower quality of healthcare and end up netting the same amount if not less in yearly income? Sharing any experience with workplace health insurance would be welcome.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14pzeqq/am_i_better_off_being_on_medicaid/,"I was on Medicaid in NYC right after college and it was honestly the best insurance I've ever had -- never worrying about crazy bills and having actually affordable medication and copays. I barely got by when I got off with my job at $80k.

I would say keep the Medicaid, as it is hard and time consuming to get approved for it again. If you aren't in the metro area, then get off when you receive an offer that can cover rent, bills, food, and a $200-300 copay amount comfortably. 

If you give up the Medicaid for a 25-30k job, you would be netting a loss, because something of that pay probably does not offer health insurance. That means you'll either have to turn to purchasing separate insurance or paying out of pocket. So insurance from the marketplace may be around $160-300/month and come with $20-45 copays, or out of pocket will be hundreds for a bottle of insulin. If your net on a 30k job is ~20k, your take home is $1.6k/month. If you have to pay for insurance and account for copays, assuming this totals to ~$500, you are left with 1.1k. NY rent, even upstate, is way above 1.1k. If you don't have to worry about rent, then you still have to worry about cost of living and that 1.1k being able to carry you for any incidentals, like an emergency visit."

How to avoid rash/chemical burns(?) from Dexcom adhesive,"Diagnosed in April, and pretty much immediately started using a Dexcom G6.

Sorry for the yucky pic :/",https://i.redd.it/0z2uttdniu9b1.jpg,"First use generic allergy spray but make sure it contains no oils. Add a layer of PURE aloe Vera gel, once it dries it can get your skin very dry: https://www.amazon.com/Badger-Aloe-Vera-Gel-4oz/dp/B079P7J5DK. 

Then, top with https://www.amazon.com/Skin-Tac-Liquid-Adhesive-Barrier-Skin/dp/B008IUA6DU

Let dry, with a hair dryer on COLD, then insert the sensor over it.

 I wait 5 minutes to ensure total adhesion. If you have the overpatch sticker (order them for free from Dexcom!) - apply the overpatch sticker FIRST to the sensor, pat down (hold sensor down with your fingers for a couple minutes). Wait the 2 minutes before clipping in the transmitter. After clipping in the transmitter, hold the sensor and sticker down to your skin with your fingers, ensuring adhesion for another ~2 minutes. 

The waiting and holding down the sticker between each step is critical, because you are using multiple topical products to alleviate reaction, which delays adhesion.

For the damaged (old sensor) sites, have a tube of 0.5-1% hydrocortisone cream on hand, as well as polysporin/neosporin (I like one that contains vitamin E). Make a little mixture of the hydrocortisone and antibiotic gel, apply for a couple days to reduce scarring."

Omnipod leaking,"Does anyone else have constant issues with their omnipod dash constantly leaking? I seem to never make it to the 3 day mark within the last month and my blood sugar has been so high because of this. I’m constantly pumping so much insulin but seeing no results and then my omnipod is wet near the site and smells like insulin so I know it’s leaking. I rotate my sites as well all the time because I know if you do it in the same spot over time your skin will reject it. But it’s really frustrating…

Does anyone have any suggestions on where to put the pump on your body where you find it might leak less? I’ve also never called customer support because I just don’t know if they would replace them or not due to them being so expensive to buy where I am from…

I’m just wondering if this is a common occurrence for anyone on the omnipod dash…",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14q6kb5/omnipod_leaking/,Are they all from the same box? Sometimes you can get a bad box and omnipod will take them back and replace them. Large boluses I’ve noticed tend to leak more often compared to smaller corrective doses. Are you applying it in areas with a lot of scar tissue or an area that moves around a lot? That can also cause some problems in my experience.
Omnipod leaking,"Does anyone else have constant issues with their omnipod dash constantly leaking? I seem to never make it to the 3 day mark within the last month and my blood sugar has been so high because of this. I’m constantly pumping so much insulin but seeing no results and then my omnipod is wet near the site and smells like insulin so I know it’s leaking. I rotate my sites as well all the time because I know if you do it in the same spot over time your skin will reject it. But it’s really frustrating…

Does anyone have any suggestions on where to put the pump on your body where you find it might leak less? I’ve also never called customer support because I just don’t know if they would replace them or not due to them being so expensive to buy where I am from…

I’m just wondering if this is a common occurrence for anyone on the omnipod dash…",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14q6kb5/omnipod_leaking/,"I’ve solved this with three things. 

1. For me the leaking seems to stem from inflammation at the cannula site, so switching to u-200 insulin allows me to inject a smaller volume of insulin and therefore less preservatives which seems to be what causes the reaction for me.  This is actually tricky because I’m currently using about half the volume of the minimum fill (36-40u by volume, this is really 72-80u of u-200 insulin), so I end up pulling the unused insulin back out of expired pods to reuse it for the next one. This is very much a YMMV thing - some people have a hard time pulling insulin out of pods, but I never have.  The conversion from u-100 to u-200 also wasn’t as simple as just cutting my rates in half - I need slightly more basal (maybe 10% more) and significantly less bolus insulin (about 20% less) compared to u-100. 

2. I use tape under my pods - tegaderm or IV3000 seems to help a lot, I’m not entirely sure why but my idea is that it just helps to stabilize the skin around the cannula and prevent tiny movements that may open up a channel along the cannula that insulin can leak out of. 

3. I never bolus more than 2u (4u of u-200) at a time. This means the occasional really large meal needs two boluses, if that happens I space them out by 15-20 minutes to try to avoid pooling around the cannula. This amount currently covers 64g of carbs for me so I’m not particularly low carb or restricting the amount of carbs I eat (but I do track calories/macros because I am losing weight and staying within a calorie range with targets for my macros, but this currently allows me up to 156g of carbs a day so it’s really not super restrictive)

Most of my pods successfully make it to 3 days now - the last few that I lost early either got snagged on something and ripped off or I just sweat them off, which in my 20+ years of pump use I know just happens sometimes, even with extra tape and adhesive."

Edit: sorry for the format I am in mobile and it is truly awful looking when posted.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14pwoxk/i_am_terrified_of_insulin_pumps/,"This post reminds me of just how far the technology has advanced in the 13 years since I was diagnosed with type 1.  
My first pump was an animus ping.  No CGM.  The Hubs named it my ""pocket pancreas"" and referred to every reiteration as the same.  
My next trial was the Medtronic Guardian 6 system, with CGM, and I *loved* the way the system would halt basal insulin when it looked like I may go low.  But, the amount of alarms that woke me in the night became quite troublesome.  
I am currently using a Tandem T-Slim with the Dexcom monitor.  I *love* the fact that, should I miscalculate, not only can basal be stopped, but a small bolus can be administered.  This has removed *so much* worry from me.  I feel so much freer!  
None of the technology is perfect.  Some find irritation from adhesives and have found pathways to combat that.  
This subreddit has made me feel empowered to combat any issue I encounter.   
So, if you wish to re-examine this option, you have every reason to.  Things have progressed."

If you don’t end up getting an omnipod, I would suggest trying steel needle sites instead of the Teflon ones. Turns out I was really allergic to the Teflon and switching to steel was a game changer!! No pain, better control of sugars, and no bumps/pus coming out afterwards. It kinda scared me to switch cuz I figured the solid needle would be more sore with movement but I never feel it :)"

Edit: sorry for the format I am in mobile and it is truly awful looking when posted.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14pwoxk/i_am_terrified_of_insulin_pumps/,"Just another Omnipod 5 fan chiming in. I had a bad time with a pump shortly after my diagnosis 11 years ago and pretty much spent the next decade with pens and (a bit later) Dexcom G5/G6. Made the switch to Omnipod 5 less than 3 months ago and IMO the pros outweigh the cons. The 200 unit capacity is usually enough for its 3 day life, and my phone (Pixel 6 Pro) was just added to their very small list of supported devices for their app. 


I didn't realize how much I would appreciate not having to carry around my pen and needle kit. The automated mode has made a huge difference in reducing overnight highs (I often eat after my evening shift). Pump changes can occur at inconvenient times, unless you change it early to avoid such situations. I've mostly worn mine on my thighs, back of arm, and abdomen. I've only had one rip off - my upper arm site got caught on a doorjamb in my house. Adhesive reaction is better than Dexcom, likely because that gets bad around day 4-5 and Omnipod only lasts 3. 


Some cons: site irritation is moderate, worse on abdomen than elsewhere I've tried. Correction boluses seem to take forever. Pump controller is basically a 2nd (cheaply made) phone in terms of size. With no Apple support and limited android, it's likely to be mandatory for most users."

Edit: sorry for the format I am in mobile and it is truly awful looking when posted.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14pwoxk/i_am_terrified_of_insulin_pumps/,"Lots of replies already, but chiming in since I have a t:slim now AND I had that same purple Medtronic pump back forever ago.

The infusion sets have changed since those purple pumps. Many have a short canula (the part inside your body) and a small adhesive circle (about the size of a quarter), so they aren’t as noticeable as the older sets.

Re:tubing, I deliberately have long tubing because I’m super talented at dropping my pump. I dropped it once very early on with the shorter 24” tubing and promptly ripped my site out. The 48” tubing has fallen out of a pocket, off my bed, out of a bra, etc hundreds of times over the years and never ripped itself out. 

I’ve been continuously on a pump since 1998 and can count on my fingers the number of times I’ve ripped out a site accidentally. Most of those times I had the site in for more days than I should (we all do it) and the edge of the adhesive was peeled up, so it caught on my bed sheets or clothes when I moved. The most traumatic one was getting a thank you hug from a kid whose Christmas I had made the awesomest ever (his words). I never told him he grabbed on in a way that yanked my site out.

The only times I’ve had pain at my site are when I’ve had it on too long in the same place, or one tiny area right above my hips on my back. I just avoid using that area for my site and immediately change it if I manage to hit that spot by accident.

The one time in life where fat is your friend is in selecting a site for infusion sets. Stay away from bones and lymph ducts. Spots near large muscles tend to change how fast your insulin moves through your body and may also bleed when you insert your set (my experience, so your results may vary).

Re: cats, I have one fuzzy asshole who thinks my tubing is a chew toy. As long as I keep the whole thing under my sheets/blankets while I sleep, she leaves it along. When I’m awake, I just keep an eye on her if she’s on my lap. She’s not generally ballsy enough to try digging it out of my pocket or anything like that."

I have more site issues (minimal) with my Dexcom than with the pump. I tried the Omnipod and while the tech was cool I couldn’t adjust to bulkiness of the pod and it’s not that big at all.

I’m a double pumper so I have TWO pumps on me at all times plus my CGM. I tuck them in a Stashbandz under my shirt most of the time and it’s been years since I had a site pulled out. At the current moment I’ve got a 30 day heart monitor going too and I’m feeling like quite the cyber person. 

I tried Omnipod for a year and it was a disaster for me. They were a great company to work with though they only offered a 90° nylon cannula then with the pods. I can’t use any of those types of insets successfully except the Medtronic quick sets which are like a big thumbtack.

I waited to get on a pump because I was intimidated by them. I've been on the Tslim/ dexcom combo platter for about 2-3 years now. I regret not getting on it sooner. The tubing is easy to tuck away, and I got used to it really quickly. I wear a sport belt around my waist that I barely feel. It's the closest thing to a working pancreas that I've had in 30 years! My a1c has improved drastically, and I actually *feel* better. If you decide to give it a try, there are so many people on the T1, tandem (or omnipod, if you go that route) and even the dexcom subs that are so helpful and knowledgeable if you have questions. Good luck!! You'll make the right decision for you=)"

Edit: sorry for the format I am in mobile and it is truly awful looking when posted.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14pwoxk/i_am_terrified_of_insulin_pumps/,"I wear my pump in my pocket with my extra tubing tucked into my waistband. I wear shorts to bed, and my pump typically behaves well, though occasionally, it will wrap around me in my sleep if it falls out. Wearing your pump in a runners belt also works well to contain the tubing. I have also just thrown my pump under my pillow to corral it while sleeping on occasion. Loose tubing will be a play toy for cats and some dogs (like my parents' 8 month old puppy), but a little care can limit problems. This also helps with the tubing caught on a door knob issue. I personally don't think ripped out tubing is painful, but it sure is a pain!! If you are concerned about tubing, you might want to go with the Omnipod or wait until the Tandem Mobi is approved (expected this year and in current FDA review). The Mobi will have the advantage of the Tandem Control-IQ algorithm, which most consider superior to Omnipod, will be about 1/2 the size of the Tandem t-slim x2, and will be convertible. It can be worn with short, 4"" long tubing, with the pump body attached to your skin with adhesive or worn using a more standard length tubing like the t-slim. This means you can change how you wear it to suit your current needs, and you can have a little more leeway in where you wear your pump site when using it 'tubeless' as the set and pump body can be a few inches apart. They also have plans to next release a holster that connects the pump to the infusion set, making it truly tubeless (I expect this will take a year or so after pump approval). 

Adhesive allergies ate a definite possibility. Many people deal with this issue every day. Solutions like using Flonase before applying the set, using tagederm under the set, or using a hydrocolloid dressing work well for most. There is lots of information about dealing with adhesive allergies if you find this to be a problem. 

Pumps can be a pain. They are definitely not something I would continue wearing if a cure was possible. I also wouldn't live without my pump, a t-slim. My control is so much better, I have the freedom to eat what I want when I want without worry, my pump treats high and low blood sugars (sort of) so that changes in activity or slightly miscounting carbs isn't an issue, and it makes the mental burden of diabetes significantly lighter. I would never go back to mdi!!!"

I am terrified of insulin pumps,"I had one when I was first diagnosed about 16 years ago and I remember nothing but awful things about it. I remembered catching the tube on something and ripping the site out or the site just hurting. I would rollover in my sleep and be woken up by a terrible stabbing pain or feeling pain in the site when I moved a certain way. They would also cause rashes and become infected. 

Have they gotten better? I want to get one but it terrifies me that I will be dealing with the same issues. The pain and irritation is not something I want to deal with again. I recently got a CGM and have not had issues with the adhesive on it, but have had issues with the adhesive on different covered. I finally found some that work but the pump still freaks me out.

High GI questins,"I would appreciate any explanation as to how to pre plan insulin before and after a higher GI meal. Firstly though, I just want to say yes I have cheat days and no I don't believe the majority of people are able to resist ANY sort of cheat day. I am also, just a very food motivated person and being recently diagnosed has already depressed me into a loop of regret and anxiety when it comes to meals. So, when is a better bolus time for say, a slightly higher GI meal, or a snack. I just read an article explaining GI and how higher GI raises BG faster. Anything else I missed on impact or affects would be most welcome info. For reference I am still waiting to see an endo after almost 3 weeks of diagnostics and I've been trying to learn the ropes myself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14q1g04/high_gi_questins/,"I try to inject 15-20 minutes before eating.  If I know I’m going to have more carbs than usual or carbs that are going to spike faster I just deal with knowing the spike is coming and it will come down.  Loading up with excess insulin to hammer down the spike means needing to eat more later to cover it.  Walking after a meal can help blunt any spike but you gotta get a feel for how much.  A CGM is really helpful.

I don’t do cheat days.  I eat what I want when I want within reason.  I can still have pizza just not three days a week and three or four slices each time.  I can have a cookie and dose for it.  I don’t need to have three cookies at once."

Things like rice or pasta that hit quick, I pre bolus 1/3 to 1/2 the dose 45min to an hour before. The rest is after eating, and I check at the 4-5 hour mark to see if I need a correction. Exercise right after eating also helps lessen the spike. I like walking and riding my bike.

I have another approach that is on an exercise heavy day (legs) and in the evening (when I am most sensitive to fast acting). I eat more carb heavy food, because my carb ratio is better. I use the same approach as above, but with less insulin and not as much of a wait. 

My freestyle really helped me nail my ratios, so if you can use one, that is a big help."

Subcutaneous shots to treat a low (opposite of insulin shots)?,"
While on MDI, we occasionally have had to give insulin shots (via Kwikpen) to our t1d kiddo for a night correction despite the basal being dialed in. Good thing is we could do it without waking him up.

So ideally if we could just give him a shot of carbs/glucose/glucagon/something subcutaneously so it doesn’t hurt any more than the quikpen that’d be great during a pinch. Should be possible in theory as dual hormone pumps presumably do this.

We have the glucagon injection which is only intended for emergencies and it’s not subcutaneous.

In case it's helpful to imagine what you're describing:  In a hospital setting, if a patient has really low glucose and isn't able to take anything by mouth, we give something called ""D50"" (Dextrose 50%) .   It's fairly concentrated (much more than the D10 or D5 we otherwise sometimes give) but you have to give a fairly significant volume of it (compared to insulin) to have it be enough to do the job of raising a low glucose.  We often give one full ""Amp"" of it -- which is 50 mL.  Sometimes we give 2 amps (100 mL).  That's the volume equivalent of 50 - 100 completely full 100-unit syringes.  And of course, it can't be administered that way.  It has to be IV.  But that's the kind of volumes it would take to correct for a low glucose by injection of sugar into the blood -- because that's what we actually do.  


Of course, this is ignoring the glucagon injection option. That's a different story.  One that I don't know enough about safety of routinely using it for treating lows, and depleting your reserves in your liver.  I'll let other reddit experts handle that one :)"

I know there is gel that will dissolve in your mouth for when you’re unable to chew/swallow, so maybe something like that?

Of course, if he’s going low often at night - then an insulin adjustment is probably necessary.

Subcutaneous shots to treat a low (opposite of insulin shots)?,"
While on MDI, we occasionally have had to give insulin shots (via Kwikpen) to our t1d kiddo for a night correction despite the basal being dialed in. Good thing is we could do it without waking him up.

Anyway - is there an easy, analogous way to inject him if he’s going too low? He can be fussy at times when we need him to eat/drink to treat a low and that’s very stressful for everyone. Yes we have many different options for him but still he has his moods…

So ideally if we could just give him a shot of carbs/glucose/glucagon/something subcutaneously so it doesn’t hurt any more than the quikpen that’d be great during a pinch. Should be possible in theory as dual hormone pumps presumably do this.

We have the glucagon injection which is only intended for emergencies and it’s not subcutaneous.

Any suggestions?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14q2ixb/subcutaneous_shots_to_treat_a_low_opposite_of/,"YES, talk to your doctor about microdosing glucagon. I have been T1 for 32+ years and have severe gastroparesis, making it almost impossible for me to bring my sugars up by eating or drinking anything. I learned about microdosing glucagon 10+ years ago online and have been successfully doing it since. It was started in the juvenile community for dealing with sick or stubborn children, but today, many people do this. 

To microdose glucagon, you need a glucagon kit (the IM injection kit, usually in a red or orange box) and u-100 insulin syringes with a minimum needle length of 6mm (it can be hard to draw glucagon from the vial with this length needle, and anything shorter would not work). You start by mixing the kit, following the instructions. Then, draw the mixed glucagon into an insulin syring and inject (subcutaneously) as usual. The mixed glucagon can be kept in the fridge for 30 days (I have used it successfully for up to 90 days, but it may lose some efficacy). I carry a predrawn syringe with me for emergencies and typically use it at room temperature for 3 days. I have also used that as old as a week out of the fridge, and it brought my sugars up, though again I can't say it is necessarily 100% effective. Personally, I find 5 units of glucagon typically raises my sugar 50-60 points. If I have insulin on board I may still crash, and if your child is in their honeymoon this will probably trigger an insulin response in the body bringing their sugars back down, so following with some carbs can be helpful, but it not usually necessary. I get 18, 5 unit syringes from each glucagon kit (90 units). Subcutaneous glucagon takes about 15 minutes to work (compared to 10 for glucagon administered intramuscularly), so it's similar to the time frame of glucose, juice, or candy.

It is recommended that you start with a 10 unit dose and adjust as needed, although if your child is just a bit low and you just don't want to wake them, I would start with more like 5 units. Microdosing glucagon avoids the side effects from taking a whole dose of glucagon (if you have never tried this, you feel awful for about 24 hours from the hormone surge and blood sugar rebound). Glucagon is also the bodies natural mechanism to deal with lows, so it's a good option. 

Talk to your doctor about microdosing glucagon. Not all of them have heard of it, but I think most have. You may need to explain what you want, but you should be able to get a prescription for this off-label use. Discuss appropriate dosing with them (my info on the starting dose is 10+ years old, and I can only give personal experience as a 40+ year old woman). I will say that microdosing glucagon is a wonderful thing, and they are still working on an insulin pump designed to administer both insulin and glucagon to regulate blood sugars - though this idea has been in the works for quite a while."

It helps to remove residual sugar sitting on their teeth and gums, which leads to dental problems later in life. 

And brushing with a lot of parental oversight is so important. It’s a common issue with diabetics, especially younger kids, to have issues early on. 

3 times a day, even while at school, and kids mouthwash once a day in the evening will cut down on gum disease and tooth decay, which also can lead to heart issues and gut biome issues down the line."

We’ve been on this journey personally for almost 6 years, and I’m still learning new things, methods and techniques all the time. 

It’s not only emotionally draining, but physically and financially exhausting. It really doesn’t make sense at time, how difficult things can be… I still have to go and sit in the bathroom at times and allow myself to decompress and even cry. No shame lol 

Also, if you are familiar with the sugarmate app, it’s a godsend with how much you can mod and use it.

The one frustrating thing was him starting school a few years ago. We needed a school with a dedicated nurse who understood T1, and were blessed to find an amazing charter school with 3 full time nurses, and one of the nurses has a T1 husband. Such a huge relief. 

It’s definitely been a journey, with lost income due to having to have us having to prioritize who works and brings in the most income, while having a parent available to support him and care for him, and go to every single birthday party, pool party, etc.

BS was 24 when I woke up today,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14plh4w/bs_was_24_when_i_woke_up_today/,"I smoked a ton of weed in high school, got type 1 junior year and it's not genetic. Nooobody in my family got any type of diabetes ever so these doctors hear that and got a wtf expression everytime ahahaha it's evil but it makes me smile and those turds are evil too.

I had a schedule for my endless shots of whiskey and juice for years, worked out pretty well for me. I just love alcohol more than weed, I'm in nyc and all I smoke is a nicotine vape now, once in a while I feel like a strong person hah. Lucky I got epilepsy, I think it erased 95% chance of feelings (not connected to my diabetes, it also came from nowhere so don't worry about that)

Despite what people will tell you about depression and whatnot, I am usually pretty balanced and used to just get hit by a wave of intense negativity sometimes. I don't think there's a final cure but don't start taking supplements and pills and shit, it's heroin. Any kind of supposed cure won't help you find that within yourself and help you have a plan for next time, one you dont need help for and are more familiar with, one that will leave you less vulnerable to it. It's helps me to kind of let my mind wander, feel completely hopeless, empty and sort of confront myself hard, let it become almost extreme until it basically fills up and then pours out, so that you're back to a standard again. If you don't have a serious mental illness, you probably can't go wrong with it and if it turns out you do, you can identify exactly what it is and get better help, understanding this way. Laying flat on the floor in a dark room with no windows at all helps me a lot, to go back in it whenever the outside world triggers you and reflect on that, just keep going through the same trial and error until you have gotten past it on your own, sort of trained yourself. Laying flat and spread out helps a lot mentally because tons of physical issues that can trigger that.

This alone was wonderful!  The next would be, as it ""gets to know you"", the math it does for carbs, along with the G6, was fantastic.  I actually learned a lot about what I really need with insulin.  Back on DMI, my levels are better than they were before trying the pod.  The micro doses were great, and my graph was so much smoother than before.  It was also nice to open the app on my phone and tell the Omnipod I was going to consume carbs, how many, without anyone knowing.  

The cons, besides my skin hating the cannula, were the following, the pod didn't like to give me more than 4 or 5 units of insulin without leaking (but that may have been the skin issue).  The pod absolutely takes forever (in my opinion) to bring down a high blood sugar.  It was not aggressive enough for my tastes.  Next would be getting used to what seems like a huge attachment to my body, but after so long with DMI, that may be just me.  I do still have marks from some of the insertion sites.    Also, there is no way to know if the pod is leaking until it's too late, the high glucose is guaranteed.  And, as a long term DMI, the lack of long-acting insulin on board seems so dangerous to me and I absolutely missed it the many times the cannula slipped out of my skin.  Last, I chose to buy a phone that allowed the Omnipod 5 app, and there aren't a lot out there that are updated, and all are Android (which I use anyway, but the choices are slim).  I just didn't want to have to carry two phones around with me.

It seems like more cons than pros, but most of them are connected to the cannula issue I have.  I would absolutely get used to the annoying bits if it weren't for that!  I recommend trying, the first month is frustrating, but then it was great (but for the cannula!).  Hopefully it works for you but do keep a full kit of pens and such with you at all times, just in case.  I think it's worth a try!"

That’s such a shame about the cannula. I wonder if other devices use the same material for their cannula and if another might work for you… At least you gained valuable knowledge from the experience. 

An important thing for me is reducing and smoothing out highs. Im getting better at staying in range but the high duration needs to reduce. So what you said about the pump’s insulin aggressiveness is something to watch. 

I’m leaning towards giving it a try.

I tried following the ADA diet recommendations for type 1. It made me worse.  Finally learned others managed type 1 with plant based vegan diets and went back to that diet. 

When we found an insulin to which I was not allergic I had a couple of 20s with both arrows down. Miraculously I survived.  

The pump and dexcom meant I could figure out new ratios quickly.  I had to readjust them after losing glucagon."

Insulin responsiveness impacted by SSRI’s?,Hi y’all!

Samsung also ""announced it"" 4 years ago, and every year since, and still nothing. 

Even if the tech is available it needs FDA approval in the US.   
Then in other countries as well.  (more delay)   
Just like when ECG and SPo2 measurement launched on the Watches, first in the US only, then months/years later elsewhere. 

What I am trying to say, you won't see this feature in a $40 Chinese watches before the Big Boys do it that's for sure."

I also don't think most people have any knowledge of macronutrients much less how it impacts diabetics. The focus on sugar is largely borne from their shopping habits. Diabetic items are catered to type 2s and it's pretty much all just sugar free stuff.

I’ve already been updating and polishing based on user feedback. This is helpful.

I’m considering adding profiles that will have 3 settings for those numbers - breakfast, lunch & dinner.

This way you could save profiles for more than one person, or if you want to do a one off calculation with different numbers it wouldn’t override your saved profile.

Do you think 3 versions of those numbers per profile would be sufficient?"

If I'm in the direct sunlight and the pump is exposed e.g., beach volleyball, I drape a wet washcloth over the pump (crude evaporative cooling).

Aside from the above, watching your sensor reading trend should alert you to insulin being denatured and losing potency. You might also consider limiting the volume of insulin in your pump cartridge in order to discard a smaller volume if it's denatured. btw, I only denatured pump insulin once and it was due to body heat during a winter hike. Now if I'm hiking or cross-country skiing, I keep the pump in an outside pocket with a pass-through for the tubing to the infusion.

I’ve had a pump for plenty of summers, and it gets hecka hot here. If I’m near an indoor area, I may disconnect if it’s less than an hour or two - won’t affect your blood sugar very much. If it’s all day, I just make sure it stays under my shirt and out of the sun, hoping for the best. There are very few times I’ve managed to actually mess up the insulin, and almost all of them happened either sitting outside in direct sunlight or being disconnected and shoved in a black soccer bag. Insulin isn’t as fragile as some people act like it is. 

If you’re actually noticing that the insulin isn’t working as well, noticeably higher for several blood sugar checks, having to take multiple correction doses, etc - then it might be time to get a wrappable ice pack to wrap the pump, and stay in the shade. You could also switch to MDI if you’re really worried about it. I hope fourth of July goes well!"

I can’t say I’ve ever encountered a time where my pump overheated, but I’m also not in the direct sun (also have a tslim and can keep it out of direct sun while on me) I have a little cooler case with ice packs for my pens, but I’m sure that would work to cool off a pump for a few minutes. If you don’t have that, an insulated lunchbox with some ice packs might work too. 

I can say for sure though, please keep hydrated. Keep drinking water throughout the time you’re outside, even if you don’t feel thirsty. 

Everyone is different, but the heat causes a lot of hypos for me and increases my insulin sensitivity like crazy. Make sure you have plenty of hypo treats, not only fast acting sugars but carbs too. I often have to pair juice with a pack of crackers when I’m outside working. 

Bring something to use as a fan. Whether that’s a little battery powered one or piece of cardboard lol huge difference between stagnant and moving air

If you can bring a cooler or something, even better. You can keep snacks/juice and a frozen bandana or hat. Keep extra waters, more than you think you’ll need. You might want to pour water on you. Keep your sunscreen in there too, reapply it to keep you cool.

Hope this helps a little with some ideas :)"
Checking sugars,"So admittedly I am not the best diabetic. 5 years ago my a1c was at a 14. I have since lowered it to a 7 and got a dexcom cgm.

That would let you know as soon as you hit your set threshold.  You can start by not setting your high alarm too high.  The standard is 180 but many people set it higher because they find alarms annoying.  If you set it for the standard 70 low and 180 high you will probably still go low & high but you can fix them before they become a real problem.

When I started checking I started putting everything in a spreadsheet. Don't download it. Write it somewhere. Force yourself to reflect on how often you checked and what the numbers were. Once you make a habit of that future you (writing down the numbers) will hold current you accountable.

I’m a mother of two and my youngest is level 3 autistic.

I can’t wear a CGM as my daughter will rip it off the moment she finds it (happened before) so I don’t monitor my BSL as much as I should. 

It’s not all black and white with diabetes management.  Some people have a lot more time on their hands to manage it better while others do not. I do try my best but I don’t always achieve my best. Not comprehending others who don’t achieve the same results as you do is silly in itself. You don’t know what their lifestyle is like, their family life, their climate, their location etc. all this can affect the ability to manage diabetes effectively.  

I guess what I’m getting at is please do not assume diabetes is a simple condition to manage. Not everyone is like you and you don’t represent the diabetes community alone."

Day to day our vision can get blurry with BG fluctuation, sure. But if you have undiagnosed advanced retinopathy, a blood vessel can burst quite suddenly. For me, I was at work one day, lifted a heavy box, and then it looked like I had been staring at a bright light and had a weird flashing after image of some shape. Over the course of an hour it got bigger, and bigger. Turns out it was blood. Took me 8 months and two laser surgeries for it to mostly absorb, and lots of visits to the eye doc. I still go in every 10 weeks for a preventative injection.

If you are a diabetic and you see something odd in your vision that is more than just being a little blurry, go get it checked out! ASAP.

Also, if you get retinopathy in the USA, check and see if your state has a medicaid buy in program for working adults with disabilities. I wish I had known that up front, it would have saved me $20k in debt."

Is there any way get assistance or find outlets that can help provide more test strips? We live in CO, USA. I'm just learning about the world of a T1D person and the struggles they face.

How would I know if my basal isn't working? What would the symptoms be?,"So I've had really bad glucose levels lately and I've honestly no idea why, my ratios shouldn't have changed, I'm not eating different and my insulin isn't as effective as it usually is.

Recently it would not, for example this morning with my breakfast my sugars went to 12mmol and only dropped to 10mmol, whereas usually it would gradually go down to normal levels.

If you’re having more trouble with your BG not coming down after eating I’d evaluate your ICR and play around slightly with it (not too much to where it’s unsafe).

Am I in the wrong? Parent of T1D,"Our daughter was diagnosed with T1 at 5 years old, she almost 11 now so it’s been close to 6 years she’s lived this life. In the past I have struggled with being hyper vigilant and the stereotypical “helicopter mom” x10 because of her diabetes. I am finally getting to a place where I can be less anxious, allowing her to live her life as a regular child for the most part and not constantly treating her as a “fragile” type 1 diabetic child. If you know what I mean? 

My anxiety and hovering was so severe that it caused my daughter to start showing signs of high anxiety + attacks and being overly cautious of everything in her life. I knew then that I had to get this under control and I worked hard to do that.

I am also the default parent so I am the one handling the more serious situations and device issues, etc. so I have lots more experience with this than my partner. He is still more on the anxious side of dealing with her diabetes. Kind of in helicopter dad mode, similar to how I used to be. It’s not entirely his fault because he is away for work often in his career and his jobs last anywhere from 1 day to 3 weeks. 

Anyways, the issue here is that my partner doesn’t feel comfortable with the fact that I am starting to allow our daughter be more independent with her diabetes care. She will bolus herself for meals without help if she doesn’t ask for it, and I leave it up to her when she changes her devices (omnipod + CGM) because she has lived with them every day for the last 6 years. 

Example, her pod is right now considered“expired” but my daughter is aware that her pod still has 25+ units of insulin and will still work for 4-7hrs so she doesn’t want to change it. I have allowed her to make that choice for a while now and her father absolutely hates it. He says I’m being neglectful and it’s going to result in a crisis that could’ve been avoided. I want to note that since I let her start taking charge of her care, there hasn’t been a single “crisis” or incident that could be blamed on my lack of attention or care, or my daughters.

He doesn’t believe we should trust her because of her age, but I would argue that she is much more aware and understanding of her needs than we are sometimes, when it comes to her diabetes. Our relationship is strong and we are great together, except for this one thing. For him the argument is a big enough issue that it impacts our relationship and it kills me.

I just really want to know if I’m being difficult and should not allow this anymore for his comfort as a T1 parent just like me, or if maybe he should realize that it’s time to let her have more responsibility and control of her diabetic care because she is getting older.

By doing what you’re doing, you’re giving her independence, control over her own condition and life, and confidence. She knows that she’s trusted to handle things herself.

That’s one of the best things my parents did for me. I’d sit your husband down and remind him that you guys don’t want your daughter to have diabetes be the thing that defines who she is. It’s definitely part of her,  but she needs to be able to make her own choices for her body.

She’s the one with the screwed up pancreas, and as of now, that’s not changing anytime soon. She needs to be able to take care of herself eventually. You won’t be there when she goes to college or starts her first job. She will need to do all of this on her own. 

The best way to parent her is exactly what you’re doing - letting her take over her care, when she’s ready, and in gradual steps. An expired pod isn’t negligent by any means, since there’s a built in grace period and it’s not out of insulin. That’s WHY Insulet put the grace period in the software in the first place. If you’re in the US, then conserving supplies and insulin isn’t a new or novel thing with diabetics. 

Your partner needs a good therapist because that behavior isn’t normal."

Anyways, the issue here is that my partner doesn’t feel comfortable with the fact that I am starting to allow our daughter be more independent with her diabetes care. She will bolus herself for meals without help if she doesn’t ask for it, and I leave it up to her when she changes her devices (omnipod + CGM) because she has lived with them every day for the last 6 years. 

Example, her pod is right now considered“expired” but my daughter is aware that her pod still has 25+ units of insulin and will still work for 4-7hrs so she doesn’t want to change it. I have allowed her to make that choice for a while now and her father absolutely hates it. He says I’m being neglectful and it’s going to result in a crisis that could’ve been avoided. I want to note that since I let her start taking charge of her care, there hasn’t been a single “crisis” or incident that could be blamed on my lack of attention or care, or my daughters.

He doesn’t believe we should trust her because of her age, but I would argue that she is much more aware and understanding of her needs than we are sometimes, when it comes to her diabetes. Our relationship is strong and we are great together, except for this one thing. For him the argument is a big enough issue that it impacts our relationship and it kills me.

I just really want to know if I’m being difficult and should not allow this anymore for his comfort as a T1 parent just like me, or if maybe he should realize that it’s time to let her have more responsibility and control of her diabetic care because she is getting older.

Letting the leash go out is a difficult thing and your husband isn't ready for it (albeit you have more input due to proximity with her diabetes). While I agree it's a family decision, maybe come up with a checklist of things your daughter is able to demonstrate to your husband to make him feel more reassured. 

Obviously you need to be safe as insulin can harm when dosed incorrectly, but y'all need to discuss it together."

He should relax. It is amazing what 11 year olds can do when allowed. I was a T1 at 11 - No CGM or pump, 40+ years ago -It was kind of wing it approach and I survived and thrived. With a CGM and Pump it would have been so easy! How does she go to a friends house or a sleep over if she doesn’t manage herself? You are the judge of her abilities - some 11 year olds I wouldn’t trust with anything, but most can handle quite a lot. Maybe your partner was one of the untrustworthy 11 year olds and he is projecting.

You didn’t mention she is going high or low all the time, so I am going to assume she is doing a good job. Wearing a pod while it is still functioning and has plenty of insulin - EVERY diabetic does this. The pod as a 3 day +8 hours for precisely this use - it has been safely tested for this. As long as she is not abusing the +8 hours (like it expires in the middle of school and she has to come home), then why would anyone care? Have your partner come to the next doctor appointment and ask questions. He seams not to want to trust anyone but himself - if he is not willing to go to next appointment (because he doesn’t want to be told he is wrong) then he needs to butt out."

The earlier your daughter can learn to manage her diabetes, the more prepared she will be for when she’s not in your house anymore.  I also think that it will prepare you for when she’s not in your house anymore.

Edit to add:  you are doing a great job in getting your anxiety under control, and you should be really proud of yourself!

**for you & your partner, it’s really important to not overreact if she makes a mistake — I was so afraid of getting in trouble because of ‘bad’ blood sugar that I had major burnout & an ED in my late teens/early twenties. Obviously can’t solely blame my parents for that but their influence definitely didn’t help. 

Check with your endo or local hospital for a T1D parents group - mine joined one when I was diagnosed and I think it was really helpful for them to have others that are translating doctor’s words into real world.

Also look into a T1D camp for your daughter if you can - they are huge for building confidence in managing diabetes & so cool to make friends that can fully relate to you."

In the past I have struggled with being hyper vigilant and the stereotypical “helicopter mom” x10 because of her diabetes. I am finally getting to a place where I can be less anxious, allowing her to live her life as a regular child for the most part and not constantly treating her as a “fragile” type 1 diabetic child. If you know what I mean? 

My anxiety and hovering was so severe that it caused my daughter to start showing signs of high anxiety + attacks and being overly cautious of everything in her life. I knew then that I had to get this under control and I worked hard to do that.

I am also the default parent so I am the one handling the more serious situations and device issues, etc. so I have lots more experience with this than my partner. He is still more on the anxious side of dealing with her diabetes. Kind of in helicopter dad mode, similar to how I used to be. It’s not entirely his fault because he is away for work often in his career and his jobs last anywhere from 1 day to 3 weeks. 

Anyways, the issue here is that my partner doesn’t feel comfortable with the fact that I am starting to allow our daughter be more independent with her diabetes care. She will bolus herself for meals without help if she doesn’t ask for it, and I leave it up to her when she changes her devices (omnipod + CGM) because she has lived with them every day for the last 6 years. 

Example, her pod is right now considered“expired” but my daughter is aware that her pod still has 25+ units of insulin and will still work for 4-7hrs so she doesn’t want to change it. I have allowed her to make that choice for a while now and her father absolutely hates it. He says I’m being neglectful and it’s going to result in a crisis that could’ve been avoided. I want to note that since I let her start taking charge of her care, there hasn’t been a single “crisis” or incident that could be blamed on my lack of attention or care, or my daughters.

He doesn’t believe we should trust her because of her age, but I would argue that she is much more aware and understanding of her needs than we are sometimes, when it comes to her diabetes. Our relationship is strong and we are great together, except for this one thing. For him the argument is a big enough issue that it impacts our relationship and it kills me.

I just really want to know if I’m being difficult and should not allow this anymore for his comfort as a T1 parent just like me, or if maybe he should realize that it’s time to let her have more responsibility and control of her diabetic care because she is getting older. 

She will soon be a preteen and want to go do things with her friends that doesn’t involve us and I would hate for her to miss out on those kinds of things because she can’t take of herself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14o10gz/am_i_in_the_wrong_parent_of_t1d/,You are 100% doing the right thing. I was diagnosed at 10 and by 11 was doing everything myself. It made me feel safer being able to do it and I learned more about my body and what it needs when I eat certain things. I also use my pump site for an extra day over the (expired) period unless it is showing inflammation or signs that it mag me malfunctioning. Saves me from throwing out 75+ units every time I change my site which helps a lot considering where I live insulin is super expensive.

For our youngest (8), we’re still doing site changes for the pump and dexcom (she doesn’t want to yet), but she does all her own carb counting, dosing, etc. Our oldest (15) does everything totally on his own outside of guidance when he asks for help or is struggling. It’s tough because we constantly worry about them, but my worry should not be their burden, and their diabetes is ultimately theirs to manage. The goal is to teach them how to do things and why so they can ultimately do everything themselves. I love them, but I don’t want them to live with me forever, and waiting until they’re adults to hand things over would be a complete disservice to them. Keep doing what you’re doing!"

You're in the trenches every day.  You recognized your anxiety issues were negatively impacting your daughter and you fixed them. You're allowing her a measure of freedom and choice in managing her disease.  She's being responsible about it.  This will be incredibly helpful as she gains more independence.    

Your partner isn't always present, sometimes for long stretches.  He parachutes in and wants his anxiety to control the situation.  That's damaging to your daughter.  He's where you were however many months ago.  He needs to get a grip and get onboard with what's working.  It's her disease.  It's his anxiety.

I’ve had it for almost 20 years now, and was diagnosed at 10. A year into it, I started to handle things on my own- giving my own shots, calculating carbs/units of insulin, treating lows, etc. She’s had it longer than I did at her age, and I do think it’s about time to let her take the reins if she’s comfortable. Hopefully, there’s a cure in her lifetime, but I’ve learned to never bank on it, so this is something she’ll have to deal with in the long term. 

From everything you’ve mentioned, it sounds like both you and your partner love her and want the best for her, so maybe it’d be a good idea to find a therapist specializing in T1D kids (I had one myself as a kid and loved being able to see her on a weekly basis). You can check with her endo and see if they know of anyone in the area, because this seems like a good discussion to have with a third party who understands the nuances of a child living with T1D. She might also want someone to talk to during this time of her life- I don’t envy her, being T1D and a pre-teen/teenager was so hard and I’m so glad I personally had someone to talk to about things and get advice from."

When we are figuring out how much insulin he needs we do the math together or at the very least explain why I’m giving him X units etc. The more involved he is the less attitude and issue we have when it’s time to do something diabetes related.

My mom was intensely a helicopter mom with me and I genuinely feel like I've missed out on a LOT of opportunities because of it. I was given independence with her in control. Sure I could bolus myself and change my own pods, but I was much older than 11 (although at that age I was new to a pump and dexcom) but it was under her supervision with her carb counting for me, her doing the math for insulin and all of that stuff. I didn't start giving myself shots until I was 10, then started a pump and dexcom at 11, I didn't change my own pods and dexcoms til I was probably 12 or older and when I did it was with supervision. I wish more than anything that I would've been given more independence. I'm 17 now and still have never slept over at someone else's house. This is the most independence I've ever had. I got my drivers license about 6 months ago. Both of my parents are still very intense helicopters and it only makes me resent them. My A1C is the best it's been at 6.1 and it's with me taking care of my diabetes 99% of the time. You are absolutely doing the right thing for your daughter. Give her that freedom but also be a net, that's what parents are for. You push them when they need it, you let them have freedom and let them make mistakes but you stay there as a net to catch them when they need you. Encourage her to do it all herself but also be there to help when she's not feeling up to it. Ever since I've become so independent I've lost most support, I've heard from diabuddies that their parents still willingly change their pods when they want/need that help and I wish I had that. Id encourage you to allow your partner to read these comments and see how helpful this independence could be for her! Give her that freedom and watch her thrive, you may both be surprised by what she is capable of, she just needs that chance to show it. Good luck to you and your family OP!!"

I was so far up him bum for a while, but I realized early on I was causing him some anxiety issues. Then I (my husband told me I had to give him space) backed up a bit and let him take the lead slowly. 

And we did all those things because of those exact reasons that you stated in your last paragraph. I was also worried that if anything happened to me or my husband he wouldn’t be prepared to take care of himself. 

He’s now going to his friends pretty often since it’s summer. He has after school activities and sleep overs. I have access to his Dexcom and he has a phone where he can call me if he needs me. But I know that he is able to take care of himself and it put my mind at ease. 

We also have a rule that if any point in time he is just burnt out and having a day that all he has to do is come to us and say I’m having a day can you please take over and we will. 

I know it’s a lot for a kid, but I have also seen adults who’s parents did everything for them as a T1 and then we’re not able to function as an adult no longer in their parents home. Then ending up in the hospital multiple times a year because they just don’t want to do it because they never really had to.

I don't think you're wrong, but your partner isn't either. I think there's a middle ground here where you both actually get everything you want. 

For you, you want your child to be able to manage their own diabetes, because it's going to be fully up to them at some point. You also don't want to prod too much and have her push back, especially as she becomes a teenager where she neglects her care from 15-22.

Your partner doesn't want anything bad to happen to her, and fears you ceding care increases those odds because she's still just a child.

The thing is, you can totally have both. You can have your daughter manage her care as much as she's comfortable, like you want but then just oversee it so you know nothing bad will happen to assuage your partner. 

The pump is a good example. It's expired, but has remaining insulin and had 6-7 hours left. You knew both of these things. Something bad will only happen if you're totally unaware and let her pump completely die leading to dka. But you knew you had time and your daughter did too (or you could at least remind her).

This is kind of like a Dexcom expiring and having a grace period. Maybe changing the pump right then and there would be inconvenient, and changing it before bed made more sense. 

Every child is different, but 11 is plenty reasonable to handle some level of care. Maybe when she boluses have her check with you first just to make him feel better. If she's spot on tell her, and tell your partner it's exactly how you would have bolused. Let them know that she's not just doing it, but doing it well. Let him know you're keeping an eye on her numbers, especially as hormones and puberty hit and may require more hands on care from you, etc."

What I noted is that you spouse can be away weeks at a time. I can imagine that it can be worrying letting go of the control in this situation. So while he trusts you and your daughter, and even if she gave him no reason to doubt her, knowing he could be hours away if something goes wrong could simply be too much.

If she has a CGM that allows it and she agrees, you could follow her BG and you would able to react if something goes really bad. But she needs to be 100% onboard with it.

I always do this, as I don’t want to waste the insulin or the pod and sometimes it’s not convenient to do a pod change when the alarm starts going off.  Omnipod user for 6 years.  It’s her Illness to manage, and she will become stronger as a person for managing it on her own.  Do you have her dexcom data on your phone?  I think that’s enough of a guardrail, maybe you could have a weekly check in for her to talk through how the week went and what her decision processes were for various situations.  Not medical advice, just t1d fellow advice, I think your partner needs to learn more about it.  It’s so overwhelming to have a helicopter person who is not diabetic, as diabetics we are forced to think about it every minute, don’t need a second person acting as an alarm as we put up with constant beeping all day.  Also, not a parent, take with grain of salt"
Am I in the wrong? Parent of T1D,"Our daughter was diagnosed with T1 at 5 years old, she almost 11 now so it’s been close to 6 years she’s lived this life. In the past I have struggled with being hyper vigilant and the stereotypical “helicopter mom” x10 because of her diabetes. I am finally getting to a place where I can be less anxious, allowing her to live her life as a regular child for the most part and not constantly treating her as a “fragile” type 1 diabetic child. If you know what I mean? 

My anxiety and hovering was so severe that it caused my daughter to start showing signs of high anxiety + attacks and being overly cautious of everything in her life. I knew then that I had to get this under control and I worked hard to do that.

I am also the default parent so I am the one handling the more serious situations and device issues, etc. so I have lots more experience with this than my partner. He is still more on the anxious side of dealing with her diabetes. Kind of in helicopter dad mode, similar to how I used to be. It’s not entirely his fault because he is away for work often in his career and his jobs last anywhere from 1 day to 3 weeks. 

Anyways, the issue here is that my partner doesn’t feel comfortable with the fact that I am starting to allow our daughter be more independent with her diabetes care. She will bolus herself for meals without help if she doesn’t ask for it, and I leave it up to her when she changes her devices (omnipod + CGM) because she has lived with them every day for the last 6 years. 

Example, her pod is right now considered“expired” but my daughter is aware that her pod still has 25+ units of insulin and will still work for 4-7hrs so she doesn’t want to change it. I have allowed her to make that choice for a while now and her father absolutely hates it. He says I’m being neglectful and it’s going to result in a crisis that could’ve been avoided. I want to note that since I let her start taking charge of her care, there hasn’t been a single “crisis” or incident that could be blamed on my lack of attention or care, or my daughters.

He doesn’t believe we should trust her because of her age, but I would argue that she is much more aware and understanding of her needs than we are sometimes, when it comes to her diabetes. Our relationship is strong and we are great together, except for this one thing. For him the argument is a big enough issue that it impacts our relationship and it kills me.

At the end of the day your daughter does know her own body and diabetes needs better than anyone, even her doctor and her parents. This disease is somewhat unique that way. As long as your daughter is continuing to be responsible and the decisions she's making are reasonable, I think you are right to trust her.

Of course, if she starts skipping insulin doses or something like that, you will have to step back in. A lot of diabetics go through a kind of denial phase, particularly in their teen years, so as she gets older you may have to revisit this system.

I think doing some kind of trust but verify system should work. Like I wouldn't leave it all on her. Trust her to manage it, but maybe you always make sure you have a tube of glucose tabs on you in case your daughter forgets one day. Or when you travel far from home let her pack her supplies, but just double check before you leave that she has backup insulin etc. So you are still trusting her to manage her own diabetes, but you are a fall back for her in case she misses something.  Let her know that Mom has her back if she makes a mistake - which she will, she's human - and that she has another person in her corner to help her (without judgement) if she needs it. If she has a CGM I would get the alerts sent to your phone as well. Don't nag her everytime her blood sugar is slightly high or low, but this way you can just kind of keep an eye out - like if she's been high for an extended period of time check in with her If she wants to try a pump change. Or if she goes low and night and you don't hear her wake up to eat a snack, go in and check on her.

This is a really difficult balance you are trying to strike and it sounds like you are doing an admirable job. Diabetes is a 24/7 job, and as a T1 myself, I know my diabetes better than anyone. Every time my mom or someone nags or second guesses me it makes we want to just lose my mind. It is really, really frustrating. But my situation was slightly different -I'm an adult now, and I was diagnosed at 16. I did my own testing and shots from the beginning. Neither of my parents has ever given me a shot. I doubt they'd know how to work my pump if they tried. They are wonderful and very supportive, but because they don't have the necessary knowledge, whenever they question me it is incredibly frusterating since they are coming at it from a place of relative ignorance. But I can't imagine being a parent of an 11 year old with diabetes. I would be very scared and anxious and would want to helicopter as well. All that is to say, I think you're doing a good job really thinking about this issue and not approaching it from a defensive posture. Your husband's reaction is natural, but it sounds like the three of you just need to sit down and talk. Being too pushy and aggressive with your daughter could cause her to withdraw and hide how her diabetes is going from you, and eventually not come to you if she is having a problem and does need help.

I completely agree with what the other commenters are saying about not reacting with anger is something goes wrong. It's okay to be scared and worried, but don't lash out. When you're diabetic being high or low can feel like a personal, almost moral failing. (especially when you're younger). For a long time I was so embarrassed when my A1c was bad. Being asked how your blood sugar is is kind of like being asked what your weight is. It took me may years to move past this way of thinking and not feel so much shame.

You don't want to make your daughter start feeling guilt and shame so she is unwilling to communicate openly with you, since she will still need your help. Even now as an adult sometimes my mom will hear my Dexcom alert and be like, ""well, why is your blood sugar high?"" in an accusatory way. It makes me want to just scream, ""because my pancreas doesn't work and sometimes this just happens!! Back off!"" You don't want to make your daughter feel that way."

You are preparing her for the real world. Do we all wish that we could be squeaky clean diabetics who change their pod the minute we get the notification that it’s expired? Sure. However, it’s just not always feasible. By teaching her that she can handle this disease on her own (within reason), you are giving her the confidence that she will need as an adult. When I was diagnosed, my mom, who is also type 1, was sitting with me while I was sobbing, trying to put on my first Dexcom. I asked if she would do it for me, and she said that this is something I had to do on my own, and that I have to know how to do these things. 

You are doing an exceptional job and I think any medical provider would agree that you are setting her up for success. She’s going to be a confident, independent person!"

We T1’s generally have to develop a very strong sense of independence to survive successfully. It sounds like you are consciously fostering that independence in your daughter. That is not easy. Puberty, socializing, a need for privacy are all coming around at the age of 11. Your partner will have to get on board for their own peace of mind. Sounds like you are doing a great job. Best to you and your daughter."
Am I in the wrong? Parent of T1D,"Our daughter was diagnosed with T1 at 5 years old, she almost 11 now so it’s been close to 6 years she’s lived this life. In the past I have struggled with being hyper vigilant and the stereotypical “helicopter mom” x10 because of her diabetes. I am finally getting to a place where I can be less anxious, allowing her to live her life as a regular child for the most part and not constantly treating her as a “fragile” type 1 diabetic child. If you know what I mean? 

My anxiety and hovering was so severe that it caused my daughter to start showing signs of high anxiety + attacks and being overly cautious of everything in her life. I knew then that I had to get this under control and I worked hard to do that.

I am also the default parent so I am the one handling the more serious situations and device issues, etc. so I have lots more experience with this than my partner. He is still more on the anxious side of dealing with her diabetes. Kind of in helicopter dad mode, similar to how I used to be. It’s not entirely his fault because he is away for work often in his career and his jobs last anywhere from 1 day to 3 weeks. 

Anyways, the issue here is that my partner doesn’t feel comfortable with the fact that I am starting to allow our daughter be more independent with her diabetes care. She will bolus herself for meals without help if she doesn’t ask for it, and I leave it up to her when she changes her devices (omnipod + CGM) because she has lived with them every day for the last 6 years. 

Example, her pod is right now considered“expired” but my daughter is aware that her pod still has 25+ units of insulin and will still work for 4-7hrs so she doesn’t want to change it. I have allowed her to make that choice for a while now and her father absolutely hates it. He says I’m being neglectful and it’s going to result in a crisis that could’ve been avoided. I want to note that since I let her start taking charge of her care, there hasn’t been a single “crisis” or incident that could be blamed on my lack of attention or care, or my daughters.

He doesn’t believe we should trust her because of her age, but I would argue that she is much more aware and understanding of her needs than we are sometimes, when it comes to her diabetes.

I've had T1D for 20 years, and it never hurts to review things like sick day protocol, making sure I have low sugars, and carb counting. Once she shows she can do it on her own (which it sounds like she has, maybe your partner just hasn't seen as much.)

Honestly, at that age she needs to be taking on the more routine pieces of care. However, as the parent you absolutely still have a role in helping her manage diabetes as her body and life change drastically.  There are harder things to manage on the horizon (choices all teenagers grapple with, she just has an extra set of consequences.)

You're on the right path, keep up the good work!"

You were once in his position. You know how it feels and how scary it was for you. Now imagine you were in that still anxious phase and he was doing things the way you are. How would you feel about it? 

While I’m not saying stop allowing her her independence, you need to see things from his side as well. 

I’d personally not allow her to continue to use an expired omnipod. We just got started with the tslim for my 6 year old. I am teaching him it needs changed the same time every day. I’m a single mom, so I’m the default parent too. I have taught him to read his own sugar, check his finger and treat his own lows. I allow him to choose if he wants to risk passing out or having a seizure or if he wants to eat the food I bolused for. I am giving him as much independence as I can, he was diagnosed a year ago.  I’m hoping he will learn how to bolus soon because the nursing company has told me we won’t get a nurse due to the shortage of nurses and me going to the school at lunch time every school day until he’s 12+ sounds like complete crap. I can’t live my life and I can’t do stuff with my toddler because I’m home waiting to go back to do his insulin. 

Continue to let her have her independence but if it makes things better with your husband get her to change her pod when it expires. If it makes your husband feel better and it needs changed anyway what’s the harm in having her change it as soon as it’s time? You’re just in a power struggle with him right now and it won’t harm her to change it a few hours earlier than “when she feels like it”."

Am I in the wrong? Parent of T1D,"Our daughter was diagnosed with T1 at 5 years old, she almost 11 now so it’s been close to 6 years she’s lived this life. In the past I have struggled with being hyper vigilant and the stereotypical “helicopter mom” x10 because of her diabetes. I am finally getting to a place where I can be less anxious, allowing her to live her life as a regular child for the most part and not constantly treating her as a “fragile” type 1 diabetic child. If you know what I mean? 

My anxiety and hovering was so severe that it caused my daughter to start showing signs of high anxiety + attacks and being overly cautious of everything in her life. I knew then that I had to get this under control and I worked hard to do that.

I am also the default parent so I am the one handling the more serious situations and device issues, etc. so I have lots more experience with this than my partner. He is still more on the anxious side of dealing with her diabetes. Kind of in helicopter dad mode, similar to how I used to be. It’s not entirely his fault because he is away for work often in his career and his jobs last anywhere from 1 day to 3 weeks. 

Anyways, the issue here is that my partner doesn’t feel comfortable with the fact that I am starting to allow our daughter be more independent with her diabetes care. She will bolus herself for meals without help if she doesn’t ask for it, and I leave it up to her when she changes her devices (omnipod + CGM) because she has lived with them every day for the last 6 years. 

Example, her pod is right now considered“expired” but my daughter is aware that her pod still has 25+ units of insulin and will still work for 4-7hrs so she doesn’t want to change it. I have allowed her to make that choice for a while now and her father absolutely hates it. He says I’m being neglectful and it’s going to result in a crisis that could’ve been avoided. I want to note that since I let her start taking charge of her care, there hasn’t been a single “crisis” or incident that could be blamed on my lack of attention or care, or my daughters.

Example, her pod is right now considered“expired” but my daughter is aware that her pod still has 25+ units of insulin and will still work for 4-7hrs so she doesn’t want to change it. I have allowed her to make that choice for a while now and her father absolutely hates it. He says I’m being neglectful and it’s going to result in a crisis that could’ve been avoided. I want to note that since I let her start taking charge of her care, there hasn’t been a single “crisis” or incident that could be blamed on my lack of attention or care, or my daughters.

He doesn’t believe we should trust her because of her age, but I would argue that she is much more aware and understanding of her needs than we are sometimes, when it comes to her diabetes. Our relationship is strong and we are great together, except for this one thing. For him the argument is a big enough issue that it impacts our relationship and it kills me.

I just really want to know if I’m being difficult and should not allow this anymore for his comfort as a T1 parent just like me, or if maybe he should realize that it’s time to let her have more responsibility and control of her diabetic care because she is getting older.

Another thing to consider is that there will inevitably be a crisis. No matter what you do, eventually there will be a circumstance that is far from ideal. You're setting her up to recognize them before they happen/get too bad, and to be a le to handle it if something does come up. The point is independence, not perfection."

I was diagnosed at 12, and my parents let me do everything myself. This was in a time where much less technology existed, and I needed to take blood sugars, count carbs (or before that, exchanges), mentally calculate insulin doses, draw, and inject insulin. Technology makes things easier. Your daughter's Omnipod will calculate the correct dose (and possibly increase and decrease her insulin dose depending on version), and the dexcom can alarm to let you both know when there is an issue. I grew up responsible for managing my disease and was much better off because of it. Contrast that with my brother, who was diagnosed at 3.5 (he is 20 years younger than I am). My parents didn't give him the freedom to control his own disease and make his own mistakes. He just turned 26 and is still not fully independent. He will go to work without changing his reservoir on his pump and run out of insulin, has to be reminded to check his supplies before a trip, and goes days without replacing his Dexcom because it's too much work or he just doesn't want to change it. Overall, he still has pretty good control, but he can not be depended on to take care of himself. My parents were not good at giving up control (even though they tried to get him to take responsibility, they still hovered), partly because he has ADHD (this makes management of diabetes more challenging, but it is possible). You don't want your child to grow up unable to care for themselves.

My suggestion for you is to brainstorm with your husband all the concerns about what could go wrong when letting your daughter manage her own care. Definitely use Dexcom follow to alert you of problem blood sugars - I would set it slightly higher and lower than your daughter's alarms to give her an opportunity to solve any problems before you get involved. Personally, I carry an insulin pen with some needles in my purse at all times (I replace it on the first of each month). This way, I can't have a pump failure, rip out a set, run out of insulin, or any other issue without a way to recover. As I am handicapped and don't drive, I can't just head to a pharmacy, go home, or manage a crisis without pre-planning. Brain storming ways to deal with problems that *could* happen is much better than not being willing to let your daughter take over because there *might* be a problem. Even you and your husband can make mistakes - I can guarantee your daughter WILL make mistakes - it's all part of being human!! Carrying some sugar (glucose, fruit snacks, candy, whatever works for you) and having a plan of how to get insulin in an emergency can deal with most, if not all diabetes related mishaps. We have ALL taken too much insulin (even double doses or a long-acting dose of rapid-acting insulin), miscounted carbs, forgotten to take insulin, etc. Life is not about preventing mistakes from happening; it's learning how to properly respond when they do. 

I completely understand your husband's fears of letting go. This is perfectly normal. Letting go is also essential to raising a healthy, well-adjusted daughter who can take care of herself! Examining the fears you have and coming up with solutions is the best way to keep your daughter safe. Letting an expired pod run for a couple of hours to utilize more of the insulin isn't an issue, unless you need to go somewhere in a rush and don't have time to change it (a pod at the end of its normal life span could have the same issue). If your daughter needs your help to change sites, then respecting your schedule is important, but it doesn't sound like this is the issue.

It sounds like your daughter is doing great with taking on the responsibilities of her disease. This is an important step, and it's good that you are giving her this opportunity to grow. Perfection isn't possible, for you or for her, so mitigating risks is the best way to ease your and your husband's fears. It also will help your daughter learn to do the same for her future. Having a vial of insulin and a replacement pod at school, her best friend's home, grandma's, etc and both rotating and replacing supplies can be of great help - many diabetics have had issue with a pump failure at work making them leave 'sick', when preparation could easily have prevented problems!"

Am I in the wrong? Parent of T1D,"Our daughter was diagnosed with T1 at 5 years old, she almost 11 now so it’s been close to 6 years she’s lived this life. In the past I have struggled with being hyper vigilant and the stereotypical “helicopter mom” x10 because of her diabetes. I am finally getting to a place where I can be less anxious, allowing her to live her life as a regular child for the most part and not constantly treating her as a “fragile” type 1 diabetic child. If you know what I mean? 

My anxiety and hovering was so severe that it caused my daughter to start showing signs of high anxiety + attacks and being overly cautious of everything in her life. I knew then that I had to get this under control and I worked hard to do that.

I am also the default parent so I am the one handling the more serious situations and device issues, etc. so I have lots more experience with this than my partner. He is still more on the anxious side of dealing with her diabetes. Kind of in helicopter dad mode, similar to how I used to be. It’s not entirely his fault because he is away for work often in his career and his jobs last anywhere from 1 day to 3 weeks. 

Anyways, the issue here is that my partner doesn’t feel comfortable with the fact that I am starting to allow our daughter be more independent with her diabetes care.

I was either high or low ALL. DAMN. DAY. I was finally so exhausted I collapsed into bed at 8:00pm and passed out. I guess my pump finally sorted everything out because I woke up at 103, so hopefully today goes better."
Am I in the wrong? Parent of T1D,"Our daughter was diagnosed with T1 at 5 years old, she almost 11 now so it’s been close to 6 years she’s lived this life. In the past I have struggled with being hyper vigilant and the stereotypical “helicopter mom” x10 because of her diabetes. I am finally getting to a place where I can be less anxious, allowing her to live her life as a regular child for the most part and not constantly treating her as a “fragile” type 1 diabetic child. If you know what I mean? 

My anxiety and hovering was so severe that it caused my daughter to start showing signs of high anxiety + attacks and being overly cautious of everything in her life. I knew then that I had to get this under control and I worked hard to do that.

I am also the default parent so I am the one handling the more serious situations and device issues, etc. so I have lots more experience with this than my partner. He is still more on the anxious side of dealing with her diabetes. Kind of in helicopter dad mode, similar to how I used to be. It’s not entirely his fault because he is away for work often in his career and his jobs last anywhere from 1 day to 3 weeks. 

Anyways, the issue here is that my partner doesn’t feel comfortable with the fact that I am starting to allow our daughter be more independent with her diabetes care. She will bolus herself for meals without help if she doesn’t ask for it, and I leave it up to her when she changes her devices (omnipod + CGM) because she has lived with them every day for the last 6 years. 

Example, her pod is right now considered“expired” but my daughter is aware that her pod still has 25+ units of insulin and will still work for 4-7hrs so she doesn’t want to change it. I have allowed her to make that choice for a while now and her father absolutely hates it. He says I’m being neglectful and it’s going to result in a crisis that could’ve been avoided. I want to note that since I let her start taking charge of her care, there hasn’t been a single “crisis” or incident that could be blamed on my lack of attention or care, or my daughters.

He doesn’t believe we should trust her because of her age, but I would argue that she is much more aware and understanding of her needs than we are sometimes, when it comes to her diabetes.

Help with my sugars! Insulin isn't working as well?,"I'm fairly newly diagnosed, November last year, and I'm a 17 year old male now struggling with my sugar levels.

I used to frequent 100% in range, it wasn't honeymoon as that ended mid march, at least that's what my endo said.

Anyways lately my sugars have just been crazy out of whack, like I take my usual carb bolus and it just doesn't work, I've been going high a lot and for long amounts of time. 

For example my ratio is 1:10 but for dinner I had 40g carbs, took 6 units, went to 15mmol! And took 4 more and it has only gone down to 10mmol.

Help?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14oadwy/help_with_my_sugars_insulin_isnt_working_as_well/,"Take a few deep breaths. Diabetes is unfortunately not as simple as “this is my carb ratio and it will work perfectly every single time”. There are a TON of variables that impact blood sugars. It’s very well possible you were still in the honeymoon phase while you were 100% in range, this isn’t sustainable for most people - especially not teenagers. If you find you’re needing more insulin, then lower your carb ratio and test it out for a week or two. It’s also possible it was the carb content - 40 carbs of salad isn’t the same as 40 carbs of pizza. It will take time to figure it out, and it’s very possible you’ll never hit that “100% all the time” that you were right after diagnosis (I know I’m not!). It’s not about perfection, it’s about making small changes until you get it mostly right. Then making more changes as needed. It’s not your fault, it’s just diabetes. I would encourage you to not expect perfection, as that’s an easy way to get burnt out. I would also maybe look into getting a therapist who is familiar with chronic illness, your endo might be able to point you in the right direction. Best of luck!"

Dexcom G7 - I Genuinely Like It,"I’ve not seen even one positive post about the G7 since its launch, so I was dubious about trying it. After holding my endo hostage in the office for 30 minutes to unleash a barrage of questions about it, my endo gave me two sensors to try, and I truly liked it, so I changed my prescription. 

I used the G6 for 5 years (after 13 years of finger sticks and a horrible year with Medtronic’s early CGM beast) before trying the G7, and I can earnestly say that I like the G7 more. I use the clarity feature within the app, and I enjoy the more precise ways in which you can tailor the notification settings. I’ve had one sensor fail so far and Dexcom sent me a new one.

I like it a lot! I only used the G6 for about 7 months as I was just diagnosed in Nov 2022, but I am on my second G7 sensor and so far I love it! I honestly find it to be more accurate from what I have noticed. 

I just replaced my first one with my second one this morning and had it fail during warm up but when I removed it saw the thing was bent (idk what it's called haha) which could happen to any CGM. Dexcom gladly is sending me a new one. Idk why people are hating on it so much, I guess everyone is having different experiences with it and those who have had not-so-good ones are being more vocal about it. 

Glad to see someone else out there is loving it like myself !"

Anyone have issues with the g7?,"My little one has had the g7 for a few months now. We have had more failed sensors than successful ones. Still love the fact that it's fewer finger pokes, but being out and having a sensor fail, or getting ""brief sensor issue"" on a consistent basis has been an issue. Dexcom is great, and keeps sending replacements, but I was curious if anyone else has had similar issues? The g6 is bigger, but seems like it is more stable.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14nvu1z/anyone_have_issues_with_the_g7/,"Yep, I’ve had many issues when I had it. I tried out the G7 for two months and hated every second of it: the sensor ripped out three times ( twice on my arm and once on my stomach), had two sensors fail or just not connect and had horrible inaccuracy - I ended up finger pricking more then looking at the receiver. I loved how small and discreet it was but I much prefer the G6 and how accurate I’ve personally found it ( I’ve used the G6 for over a year now ). Although the G7 was supposed to be revolutionary, I personally found it worse then finger pricks."

Did you vision correction change after being diagnosed?,"I was diagnosed with Type 1 my junior year of high school.

A couple months later, made an appointment with eye doctor for baseline and make sure no signs of diabetic retinopathy were starting. For the last 30 years I’ve had a fairly stable Rx for distance but now no longer need it.  Actually told eye doctor “ I think diabetes made my vision better”.  She disagreed and said I had the start of cataracts and this could be the reason my vision was better.

This causes them to slightly change shape. After diagnosis you return to normal hydration status rapidly. This rapid change is difficult for your body to account for thus the blurry (or in your case corrected) vision. It eventually goes back to your normal status after you body compensates.

I had just been diagnosed.  I was also having blurry vision.  I went to the eye appointment, and they recommended not getting glasses because of the recent diagnosis because my vision would likely change as my glucose levels corrected.  So he recommended contacts.  I did that.  I used them for a week or two (this was 1997 - I don't remember exactly but it wasn't long) when I realized that my vision was worse with them in than with them out.  So I stopped wearing them.

I am T1D and eat low carb, primarily meat ,veggies , limited dairy. You still have to bolus for the protein, and yes it’s tough and all trial and error. Read about it, it’s pretty interesting. 

I’m on a pump and I run a higher temp basal after I eat meat for 2-3 hours to avoid the spike, it helps me. A lot of people might split dose and bolus some before meal and some after. 

Fwiw- If I don’t do it right I’m 200 as well. For me it’s tiny boluses and increased temp basal. Good luck. You’ll figure it out!  

Some helpful websites/podcasts include Juicebox Podcast ( they have an entire episode on bolusing for protein) and Dr. Bernstein’s The Diabetes Solution.

Chicken, beef ,pork , eggs all affect me differently . When I started low carb someone once told me a rough estimate is to add up the protein and cut that number in half, bolus for that."

Other proteins- maybe you are just sensitive to protein. In the absence of carbs the body will utilise protein for fuel by essentially turning it into glucose. 

It is part of the process behind keto diets: the body stops using carbs and uses and burns fats and protein for fuel instead. Protein, therefore, can cause a rise in blood sugar (it is usually a delayed reaction, not as fast as carbs because it takes time for the body to change protein cells into glucose. It is also usually a slower and steadier raise in blood sugar compared to absorption of carbs.)

How much does your BG increase over two to three hours when you eat the protein only meal? You might find you need an insulin dose to control the rise.

…

Otherwise… is your basal rate dialled in correctly? Would you rise if you didn’t eat the meal at all? You might need a bigger basal dose (or split morning and night)"

Still mad about my diagnosis 26 years later…,"I want to share my diagnosis story and see if anyone else has dealt with something like this. Sorry if I start rambling…

I’m 36 years old now, but when I was 10 years old I was diagnosed with Type 1. I was a kind of chubby, short girl in fifth grade. One day I wasn’t really hungry and didn’t eat. I thought it was pretty strange, but over time I just felt nauseous all the time and felt like I couldn’t eat. (A lot of people say they were overly hungry before being diagnosed. I was the opposite.) I was always exhausted and thirsty. I would wake up in the middle of the night and drink water out of my bathroom faucet. Of course I had to pee ALL the time.

My parents were obviously worried about me and took me to my pediatrician. I actually went a few times during a six month period, and each time he told my parents that I was anorexic. At that age, I didn’t even know what that meant. I went from about 100 pounds to 64 pounds in six months. My arms and legs were like little twigs. I still had a slightly chubby stomach because I’ve always carried my weight there. I DID enjoy that I wasn’t the chubby girl anymore, but I have since had major insecurities about my fluctuating weight. I had a teacher who gave me morning detention one time (before diagnosis) because I had to go pee during class and I couldn’t hold it. My mom went in the next day and raised hell. She told my teacher something was going on and we couldn’t figure it out. 

Then one day, my pediatrician thought it might be a good idea to do a urinalysis. And guess what? I was spilling a ton of glucose in my urine. He then decided to do a blood test and immediately sent me to the hospital. My blood sugar was 496 that night, then 46 the next morning.

Anyways… At this point, I’m just rambling. But it still infuriates me that a children’s doctor who deals with diabetes and knows what it is brushed off my symptoms for SIX MONTHS.

Anyone else have a shitty road to their diagnosis?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14nibw5/still_mad_about_my_diagnosis_26_years_later/,"I’m sorry you had to go through that.  It makes me incredibly mad whenever I read a story in the new about a kid who nearly died because it took so long to diagnose them.  Like, meters are available everywhere and strips aren’t that expensive.  Why doesn’t every doctor’s office have one?  They should do a finger stick test on everyone no matter hat the reason for their visit is.  They take your temperature, weigh you, blood pressure.  A finger poke should also be standard.  

It’s not like Type 1 is some rare, little known condition.  Everyone knows the classic symptoms.  Why do doctors immediately think of a “bug” when a parent says their kid is drinking and peeing and puking and lethargic all the time?  Use a fucking meter on the kid!

I did not have a traumatic diagnosis and I was 19, but it pisses me off when doctors don’t think of such an obvious diagnosis/test for such classic symptoms.  I was diagnosed with asthma when I was 2.  My mother said she took me to the pediatrician who told her I “just wanted attention”.  She found a new pediatrician."

I’m 36 years old now, but when I was 10 years old I was diagnosed with Type 1. I was a kind of chubby, short girl in fifth grade. One day I wasn’t really hungry and didn’t eat. I thought it was pretty strange, but over time I just felt nauseous all the time and felt like I couldn’t eat. (A lot of people say they were overly hungry before being diagnosed. I was the opposite.) I was always exhausted and thirsty. I would wake up in the middle of the night and drink water out of my bathroom faucet. Of course I had to pee ALL the time.

My parents were obviously worried about me and took me to my pediatrician. I actually went a few times during a six month period, and each time he told my parents that I was anorexic. At that age, I didn’t even know what that meant. I went from about 100 pounds to 64 pounds in six months. My arms and legs were like little twigs. I still had a slightly chubby stomach because I’ve always carried my weight there. I DID enjoy that I wasn’t the chubby girl anymore, but I have since had major insecurities about my fluctuating weight. I had a teacher who gave me morning detention one time (before diagnosis) because I had to go pee during class and I couldn’t hold it. My mom went in the next day and raised hell. She told my teacher something was going on and we couldn’t figure it out. 

Then one day, my pediatrician thought it might be a good idea to do a urinalysis. And guess what? I was spilling a ton of glucose in my urine. He then decided to do a blood test and immediately sent me to the hospital. My blood sugar was 496 that night, then 46 the next morning.

I was 17 at diagnosis, in the custody of the state of Arizona. I remember being seen by a doctor for a physical of some sort and they said to me “there’s so much sugar in your urine”, I said “I drink a lot of mountain dew 🤷🏻‍♀️”. A few months later and I’m down to 78lbs, living in a youth shelter, starving, dying of thirst. I would do the same thing with the bathroom faucet because the shelter staff were scared I was going to give myself water poisoning. I could only get water when I was in the bathroom! 

After taco night, I laid down on the couch in the front room of the shelter and woke up in the ER. Blood sugar was 1180, A1c was 22. The glucose-filled urine was 4 months prior. I’m so grateful to still be alive. I didn’t have family looking out for me, parents taking me to the doctor, asking what was wrong. I was shuffled from youth shelter to group home and back and no one really knew me well enough to know something was wrong. They knew I had a history of trauma and assumed I was dealing with anorexia as well. 

I’m now an emergency room social worker and I take such peace and comfort in knowing how much more educated physicians and hospitals etc are now, and blood glucose is checked so quickly even when diabetes isn’t a suspicion just to be sure. 

Proud of us, friend! We are still here! 🖤"

I was 13 at diagnoses and i was easily drinking 3 liters of water a day for 3 months. then because my sugars were so high i stopped drinking purified water because it tasted sweet and i was only drinking tap water. getting up to drink water was the only thing that could get me out of bed or off the couch i was in that incredibly lethargic state for about 2 weeks until my mom decided that something was seriously wrong with me. she decided that i had to go to the er. when we got there my bg was 817mg/dl and the er doctor told me that if we hadn’t come in i would have had 2 hours to live which was incredibly scary for a 13 year old in severe dka. before passing out in the hospital bed i remember saying to my mom “am i dying mom?”

I do remember going on holiday in the summer & feeling really ill while I was there; turns out I had rubella. I seemed to get better but never got back to 100% health. I know I was taken to the doctors loads of times but was told she still recovering from rubella give her a tonic, it’s a tummy upset, gastric flu, a random virus. I’ve only got 2 vivid memories; one of being in the bathroom drinking out the bathroom tap whilst peeing into to toilet at the same time. I literally couldn’t get enough water down my throat & even though I had water in my mouth my mouth feeling really dry. The other is being in my Mum & Dads bed hearing my Mum crying & a strange man in a uniform saying the word insulin & diabetic. I’d fallen into a coma & parents had called an ambulance; the paramedic knew the minute he walked in the bedroom cos he could smell the ketones. I was in hospital (over Christmas) for about 2 months & in intensive care for 2 weeks. My parents were told to say their goodbyes as everyone was sure I wouldn’t survive. I’m still here kicking diabetes into touch (and with no complications!) proving everyone wrong. Diabetes has never stopped me doing anything I want - in fact the more I’m told I can’t do something the more I try to hardest to do it! 

We are amazingly lucky with todays modern tech & advances being made; the survival rate long term for those with type 1 is very good provided we control it & the new tech makes that so much easier. 

I’m often asked if you could choose not to be a diabetic anymore would you? I always answer no! I don’t remember not being a diabetic & I’ve achieved a lot of things in my life because of diabetes that I possibly wouldn’t have attempted because no one would have said “oh diabetics can’t do that”

Is it a pain in the arse? God yes! Does it piss me off at times? Of course it does. But me being angry or sad about it doesn’t make it go away; it just ruins the time we have left & God knows there’s precious little of that for anyone! We’re all in the same queue heading towards the grave; you can either stand quietly in the queue waiting for your turn or join the party at the side & dance your way there."

I wasn’t overweight but medical standards but had a little tummy and as everyone knows as a 10 year old girl people start focusing on your weight. I remember the summer right before I was diagnosed people at a cabin we used to be at started commenting that I was thinning out and that puberty was going to be a blessing for me. Jeeze. Over the fall I slowly started to get symptoms. I had just started 6th grade and my mom started taking me to my pediatrician. I felt okay until late October when I got strep. I think strep is the thing that broke the camels back and really spurred my type 1 into motion. Over the next two months my mom took me to the same doc I had since I was born. He reiterated to my mom over and over again that I had social issues- I was acting out because I was starting a new school. Meanwhile my math teacher had a conference with my parents because he noticed I was losing weight rapidly and thought I was anorexic. Like you- didn’t know what that meant. My parents actually pulled me aside to ask if I was eating or if I was eating and puking because I was eating all the time. Thanksgiving happens and I’m still not too. Two weeks later I’m in full blown dka and I remember waking up and telling my mom I’m not going to school or I’m going to vomit. We fought because at this point she’s trying to believe me but doctors that she worked with (she used to be a medical assistant) told her I was fine. What ultimately led to my diagnosis is the day I stayed home, I took a bath. I was so weak and had been vomiting all day. My mom helped me to the tub and since I was 11 it was the first time she had seen me with clothes off. I was so thin you could see every bone. We rushed to a new doc, he smelt my breath and ordered all the tests you can think of. After like ten minutes he walks in and im like half awake on the bed and he goes I don’t want to tell you this but your daughter is a type 1 diabetic and she has to go to the hospital now as she’s in dka. He literally saved my life. To this day, I still don’t fully trust doctors but am such a strong advocate for myself."
Still mad about my diagnosis 26 years later…,"I want to share my diagnosis story and see if anyone else has dealt with something like this. Sorry if I start rambling…

I’m 36 years old now, but when I was 10 years old I was diagnosed with Type 1. I was a kind of chubby, short girl in fifth grade. One day I wasn’t really hungry and didn’t eat. I thought it was pretty strange, but over time I just felt nauseous all the time and felt like I couldn’t eat. (A lot of people say they were overly hungry before being diagnosed. I was the opposite.) I was always exhausted and thirsty. I would wake up in the middle of the night and drink water out of my bathroom faucet. Of course I had to pee ALL the time.

My parents were obviously worried about me and took me to my pediatrician. I actually went a few times during a six month period, and each time he told my parents that I was anorexic. At that age, I didn’t even know what that meant. I went from about 100 pounds to 64 pounds in six months. My arms and legs were like little twigs. I still had a slightly chubby stomach because I’ve always carried my weight there. I DID enjoy that I wasn’t the chubby girl anymore, but I have since had major insecurities about my fluctuating weight. I had a teacher who gave me morning detention one time (before diagnosis) because I had to go pee during class and I couldn’t hold it. My mom went in the next day and raised hell. She told my teacher something was going on and we couldn’t figure it out. 

Then one day, my pediatrician thought it might be a good idea to do a urinalysis. And guess what? I was spilling a ton of glucose in my urine. He then decided to do a blood test and immediately sent me to the hospital. My blood sugar was 496 that night, then 46 the next morning. I got to go home that next day, but felt really bad about the six year-old in the next room who was there for like two months. But my parents did buy me a Tamagotchi while in the hospital, so that was kind of cool. Oh, did I mention this was one week before Halloween? 😅

I’ve had a lot of ups and downs since then… a lot of stupid choices and not caring about myself. I’ve gone through many self-destructive phases where I ended up in the hospital multiple times. The other day my mom told me that around the time I started getting sick, I changed from a slightly shy but bubbly happy kid into a sad shell of my former self. That really bummed me out honestly. I have been diagnosed with bipolar type 2 disorder and anxiety as an adult, and I wonder if there is some sort of connection?

Anyways… At this point, I’m just rambling. But it still infuriates me that a children’s doctor who deals with diabetes and knows what it is brushed off my symptoms for SIX MONTHS. That time period was hell for me. My dad was so worried about me, and he would basically force feed me at the dinner table if I wasn’t eating. He made me drink Boost all the time. He was SO stressed and upset and I felt guilty that I was the cause of it. I just gave away my food at school because I just couldn’t stomach it. Six months. I’m still completely baffled by this.

I was diagnosed at 16. At the time I had mono and was losing weight and going blind. I was thirsty all the time and pissing constantly. I went to my doctor multiple times and he would say it was mono side effects. Classic diabetes symptoms just written off. He would then advise my parents behind my back that I had an eating disorder. After a month of this one morning I could barely get out of bed. I went to the ER and a nurse without half the training as my doctor diagnosed me. My blood sugar was over 700. 
   Fuck doctors, they have a god complex. Now that I’m diagnosed they are still no help. Most are deaf and blind to ANY issues you have. In the US they are part of the for-profit medicine “game” and just as guilty as insurance companies who put profits before people. 

I’m looking at you, Joslin Diabetes Clinic… greedy worthless fucks."

Anyone else have a shitty road to their diagnosis?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14nibw5/still_mad_about_my_diagnosis_26_years_later/,"I was 32, pregnant for the first time with twins, married for almost a year. I have always fluctuated with weight. I've been skinny and fat. When we went for our 9 week scan, baby A didn't have a heartbeat. Tough to hear, but was told that can happen with twins and many women lose a twin before their first scan and never knew they were even carrying twins. Asked about baby B and if they were OK. Doc said yes and everything should go well from here. At about 12 to 14 weeks, I was dropping a little weight. Not great when pregnant, but it was just a few pounds. Again, doc wasn't worried. I noticed I was thirsty more and peeing more, but of course Google said it happens in first trimester. Now at about 16 to 17 weeks, I really started to get thirsty. At about 18 1/2 weeks, I told my mom how I couldn't really quench my thirst and Popsicles seemed the only thing that could actually quench the thirst. She said, I think that happens with diabetes. I told her my glucose test was at 20 weeks. We both thought to wait till then. BIG MISTAKE. At 19 weeks and 1 day, I went pee. When I wiped, I noticed this odd mucus thing. Went to bed and at 6 am, I felt a gush. Went to the bathroom and knew something wasn't right. The water was clear and didn't smell like pee. Soon after contractions started. My husband took us to the hospital. Sure enough, I was in labor and there was no saving our son. I was told ""this is just bad luck"" and 1 in 4 women will miscarry. I said I was really thirsty before this happened, could that be why? Told nope, bad luck. Gave birth to Hunter shortly after. That was by far the most horrific moment of my life. Knowing that my son was gone and it was my bad luck. Went for my post partem check up and again asked what could have caused this. Again, was told it happens and we can try again. Had endo appointment for my thyroid. They decided since I just miscarried to do a full metabolic panel

There in the papers was the cause...Antibodies through the God damn roof, blood sugar 485 and A1C was 13. My doc basically said, when I got pregnant, my immune system went complete batshit and instead of attacking the babies, it went to my pancreas and inihalated it. Type 1 caused my thirst, weight loss and possibly miscarriage. So on top of losing my son, I also got a life long uncurable disease...not what I was expecting at all. Devastated on top of guilt that there were signs and I missed them all. I switched gynos after that. Had a healthy baby boy later that year. Pre term birth happened again, but my new gyno knew that this pregnancy was perfect and my A1C was 5.9 the whole time.

By the time my next son was born, she knew in her gut that I may not make enough progesterone. So at 18 weeks til labor I got a weekly shot to try to keep my baby cooking. Thankfully, my third pregnancy and third son was born just a few days shy of induction date of 37 weeks. Both are healthy and currently diabetes free at 8 and 5 years old.

I'm still pissed I'm a T1D, pissed I knew NOTHING and pissed that this damn disease is my door prize for my ignorance. But even with all that, it doesn't control me like it once did. Having a pump really helps to put it more at the back of my mind then the forefront. This disease is tough and I wouldn't wish it on anyone. But I have it and it's not going anywhere. I gotta roll with it and suck up the fact that we will always be shelling out a crapton of money to have insurance and to keep me alive. 

I just feel really lucky to have been able to have 2 great little boys who drive me bonkers and fill my entire world. I will always desperatley love and miss my Hunter. I wish we had more time with him, but through the loss of him, I understand how to be your own advocate. I will NEVER make that mistake again. I will fight to be heard and if the answers I'm getting don't make sense, I will seek out more somewhere else. Especially with T1D. I know me and I know T1D effects every person differently. Be your own advocate and fight for yourself."

My diagnoses were weird, most people are diagnosed with T1D then celiac but I was the opposite. My mom said my big signs were that I hadn't grown or gained any weight at all in over a year because of both diagnoses. We spent a weekend in the hospital, not super long because my mom was already trained on shots and everything, I was sent home on Halloween day, my parents definitely had to say no to trick or treating that year. It's been almost 12 years now and im still here and still fighting. It has never once been easy and I'm sure everyone can agree it'll never get easier, but we all learn how to navigate our new life. So for anyone newly diagnosed reading this just know it's not the end of the road. You will learn how to manage it and not allow it to rule your life. Does that mean it'll be easy? Hell no, it never fails to be a pain in the ass. It's okay to have hard days, it's okay to cry and just want to give up, maybe even bad weeks too. Diabetes gets thrown on the back burner sometimes and that's okay. I'm currently bouncing back from having a couple weeks of awful numbers, I was at 37% in range for a couple days. It'll all be okay, you will learn how to adjust to your new life and everyone around you who is worth while will be there to help you learn that new life as well. Good luck on your new adventure! And good job to you OP, keep fighting!"
Still mad about my diagnosis 26 years later…,"I want to share my diagnosis story and see if anyone else has dealt with something like this. Sorry if I start rambling…

I’m 36 years old now, but when I was 10 years old I was diagnosed with Type 1. I was a kind of chubby, short girl in fifth grade. One day I wasn’t really hungry and didn’t eat. I thought it was pretty strange, but over time I just felt nauseous all the time and felt like I couldn’t eat. (A lot of people say they were overly hungry before being diagnosed. I was the opposite.) I was always exhausted and thirsty. I would wake up in the middle of the night and drink water out of my bathroom faucet. Of course I had to pee ALL the time.

My parents were obviously worried about me and took me to my pediatrician. I actually went a few times during a six month period, and each time he told my parents that I was anorexic. At that age, I didn’t even know what that meant. I went from about 100 pounds to 64 pounds in six months. My arms and legs were like little twigs. I still had a slightly chubby stomach because I’ve always carried my weight there. I DID enjoy that I wasn’t the chubby girl anymore, but I have since had major insecurities about my fluctuating weight. I had a teacher who gave me morning detention one time (before diagnosis) because I had to go pee during class and I couldn’t hold it. My mom went in the next day and raised hell. She told my teacher something was going on and we couldn’t figure it out. 

Then one day, my pediatrician thought it might be a good idea to do a urinalysis. And guess what? I was spilling a ton of glucose in my urine. He then decided to do a blood test and immediately sent me to the hospital. My blood sugar was 496 that night, then 46 the next morning. I got to go home that next day, but felt really bad about the six year-old in the next room who was there for like two months. But my parents did buy me a Tamagotchi while in the hospital, so that was kind of cool. Oh, did I mention this was one week before Halloween? 😅

I’ve had a lot of ups and downs since then… a lot of stupid choices and not caring about myself. I’ve gone through many self-destructive phases where I ended up in the hospital multiple times. The other day my mom told me that around the time I started getting sick, I changed from a slightly shy but bubbly happy kid into a sad shell of my former self. That really bummed me out honestly. I have been diagnosed with bipolar type 2 disorder and anxiety as an adult, and I wonder if there is some sort of connection?

Anyways… At this point, I’m just rambling. But it still infuriates me that a children’s doctor who deals with diabetes and knows what it is brushed off my symptoms for SIX MONTHS. That time period was hell for me. My dad was so worried about me, and he would basically force feed me at the dinner table if I wasn’t eating. He made me drink Boost all the time. He was SO stressed and upset and I felt guilty that I was the cause of it. I just gave away my food at school because I just couldn’t stomach it. Six months. I’m still completely baffled by this. 

Anyone else have a shitty road to their diagnosis?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14nibw5/still_mad_about_my_diagnosis_26_years_later/,"That's no fun. I can't imagine the addition of being so young and not really being able to fully understand post diagnosis the implications of not being able to have birthday cake or ice cream at a party (without a special insulin adventure to make me look different). 

I was 33 and in the middle of an international adoption. In that process a complete physical is required. That included an A1c and it was 5.3. Meant nothing to me other than the word ""normal"" next to it.  For years I tried on/off to lose the 15 pounds I'd gained since college.

My brother in law was getting married and I declared ""no dieting at the wedding events"". When I got home I had lost 4 pounds. Suck it diet, see what happens when I ignore you?

Then I continued to lose weight.  It was weird but otherwise young and healthy/fit. And we didn't want to upset the adoption process. So my wife would try to fatten me up with pie. She would always have one around and it (was) one of my favorite things per diagnosis. And had been off the menu for a long time bc of the diet. 

Weight loss piled on and so did the thirst and peeing and feeling generally wiped out. Water tasted delicious. Skin started to get randomly itchy in places. 

By about 90 days after that A1c, I had lost 45 pounds. I  was 140 pounds and clothes were hanging off me. It happened very quickly and people at work started asking if I was ok. So back to Dr. I don't have a record of the A1c but he diagnosed me as T2 and put me on glimepride with and referred me to the Portland Diabetes and Endocrinology Center (shout out to a the home or the best doctor I have ever had of a total of 8).  Soonest they could see a new patient was a few more weeks. 

But at least I could moderate what I ate (I didn't know enough to effectively manage with my still in honeymoon phase pancreas. I could have managed knowing what I know now after having lived a few years with it in honeymoon.   I have told a lot of people how grateful I am for not having had this burden until after college.  I would have struggled for sure with maintaining anything like a normal blood sugar level in those years based on my earliest competency and knowing what my peer group lifestyle was. 

I'm now 180, ~10 pounds over my college weight.  With a closed loop insulin pump and a lot of work stress I had reached 208 before getting serious about paying close attention to which foods were contribution do digestion or blood sugar spikes. CGM technology, (dexcom, etc) have made this possible. There's only so many finger pricks you can give yourself and the strips aren't free. 

I am also fortunate to have never been in the ER due to diabetes. After about 2 years from diagnosis, I went onto a minimed pump. Great experience and solid technology. They were acquired by Medtronic who continued to innovate and had one of the first closed loop systems. I eventually grew to despise it.  It would alarm constantly, otter right after I callibrated telling it my finger stick was considerably higher than it was. I told it. And then two minutes later when I'd just started to think about something else than the headache of being diabetic, the pump helpfully would inform that blood sugar was too high. Can't ignore the pump, gotta bust it out and silence the alarm. Tubing would catch on doorknobs.  They were always prompt with replacement matters and not unreasonable ever.  But the quality seemed to slide, or my tolerance for the annoyances of it exceeded the benefit I felt I was getting.

I switched to omnipod dash, now onmipod5 and dexcom6 using Fiasp fast acting insulin.  Game changing.  

 I manage to a A1c that ranges between 5.8-6.8. I eat a low carb diet. I walk the dog 4-8 miles per day.  I drink no alcohol. I am in range 70-85 percent of the time but pust lunch is hard for me. Haven't cracked that code without suffering an evening low - if anyone read this far and has ideas, I'm listening. My diet is primarily, protein, vegetables, water coffee (with cream) nuts and cheese and berries.  Very rarely stone fruits.  I will eat ice cream in evening occasionally. This doesn't cause a spike for me with a correct bolus. Carbs from carbohydrate outside of the above is less than 30 per day excepting glucose to treat a low."

I kept getting yeast infections and experienced a level of exhaustion I couldn’t comprehend, but chalked it up to 5 kids including a newborn. My vision was often blurry and I would sleep frequently during the day. My doctor kept checking my urine, but after 6 months of symptoms he finally ordered a blood test. Then a diagnosis of type 2. 5 months after that, another blood test and a diagnosis amendment to type 1. I was never hospitalized or taught how to deal with type 1, I had taken several classes on type 2. It’s been a shit show since and has left me pretty bitter about this disease and the way I’ve been treated over it. I lost jobs because of it, I’ve lost so much. I’m glad now there’s pumps and cgms, to be diagnosed now is much kinder, you get a lot of options for better control. I started on pork insulin, and had really no idea how to carb count, so when I look back I cringe at how badly I mangled controlling things, and the doctors I looked towards for help let me just hanging and got mad when my A1C was over 8…if you have a good support system, cherish it.

This hit me like a brick, my mom said this too. I was 9 when diagnosed and turning 30 this year. And yeah, people with diabetes have hormone irregulation, this causes emotion regulation issues, which is often misdiagnosed as bipolar or if you also have ADHD, borderline. You probably don't have this, you just show symptoms of it since these are the same symptons diabetes causes but aren't used as a rule out for the others. I have ADHD too and was misdiagnosed with borderline, I don't have the key symptoms but I had enough of the overall symptoms to still get the diagnosis, the therapy worked and I got a job where they can't fire me over emotional outburst out of it but every other psychologist I spoke to told me they don't believe I really have the disorder, but since I got some positive stuff out of it, revoking it will cause more harm then good. 

I didn't go six months without diagnosis, it took 3 weeks, my doctor said I had a stomach flue, idiot didn't even tell her to take me in, he just diagnosed me over the phone, now I get how he also didn't think about cancer last year, dumbed his ass after that one, so after a week of being sick on the first vacation, then sick at home for two weeks, my mom said we weren't cancelling the second vacation since I could be sick there too. So they stuck me in a car and took the whole family to the beach 3 hours away. Once there, my mom stuck me on the couch and went to the beach with my sisters. Leaving my dad and me behind to wait for his best friend and family. So the friend got there, he had seen me a month prior, healthy, and said that this wasn't something I should sick out at home. IDK how it went from there, I remember sitting in some docs office who kept asking me questions I couldn't answer because I felt like shit. Eventually I woke up in the hospital, IDK how long I was out, but I was hooked up, everyone crying and still felt like crap. Then they came in with an insuline pen and told me they had to stab me with it. Not explaining to the dumb 9 year old that they still had to put a needle on there so I freaked the fuck out since I thought they where going to stab me with a thick fucking pen lol. So another traumatic event later, I was treated, brought to the hospital in my home town and made aware with the doctors there."

I still had a slightly chubby stomach because I’ve always carried my weight there. I DID enjoy that I wasn’t the chubby girl anymore, but I have since had major insecurities about my fluctuating weight. I had a teacher who gave me morning detention one time (before diagnosis) because I had to go pee during class and I couldn’t hold it. My mom went in the next day and raised hell. She told my teacher something was going on and we couldn’t figure it out. 

Then one day, my pediatrician thought it might be a good idea to do a urinalysis. And guess what? I was spilling a ton of glucose in my urine. He then decided to do a blood test and immediately sent me to the hospital. My blood sugar was 496 that night, then 46 the next morning. I got to go home that next day, but felt really bad about the six year-old in the next room who was there for like two months. But my parents did buy me a Tamagotchi while in the hospital, so that was kind of cool. Oh, did I mention this was one week before Halloween? 😅

I’ve had a lot of ups and downs since then… a lot of stupid choices and not caring about myself. I’ve gone through many self-destructive phases where I ended up in the hospital multiple times. The other day my mom told me that around the time I started getting sick, I changed from a slightly shy but bubbly happy kid into a sad shell of my former self. That really bummed me out honestly. I have been diagnosed with bipolar type 2 disorder and anxiety as an adult, and I wonder if there is some sort of connection?

Anyways… At this point, I’m just rambling. But it still infuriates me that a children’s doctor who deals with diabetes and knows what it is brushed off my symptoms for SIX MONTHS. That time period was hell for me. My dad was so worried about me, and he would basically force feed me at the dinner table if I wasn’t eating. He made me drink Boost all the time. He was SO stressed and upset and I felt guilty that I was the cause of it. I just gave away my food at school because I just couldn’t stomach it. Six months. I’m still completely baffled by this. 

Anyone else have a shitty road to their diagnosis?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14nibw5/still_mad_about_my_diagnosis_26_years_later/,"For me, before anyone knew I had diabetes, my best friend's mom contacted my mom and said I was in the bathroom constantly and dropping a lot of weight and thought I may be throwing up my food. I was 14 at the time and turning 15 in a month. 

A few weeks later I was on vacation and got the worst yeast infection ever. I was not sexually active at this time either. I ended up having an allergic reaction to the vagisil cream my mom bought me to try and end and I ended up in the e.r. with the worst allergic chemical reaction to the vagisil. 

A week after that I came down with the ""flu"" throwing up, shivering, end of summer... My mother kept giving me flat sprite to calm my stomach but it was only getting worse...    The next day I stayed home from school because we thought I had the stomach flu... My dad came home because he forgot his work hat and looked at me. I told him I think I needed to go to the hospital and he knew I was not joking... 

Walked into the e.r.... passed out walking through the doors... As we were walking in a pilot from life flight saw me and immediately told them to test me for type 1 diabetes. My sugar was over 1000 and they didn't know how I wasn't in a coma. I was then life flighted to a children's hospital.. on my 15th birthday.   22 years ago.  A nice week in the ICU, 1 week in a regular room... It's been a roller coaster. I hate this disease."

Anyone else have a shitty road to their diagnosis?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14nibw5/still_mad_about_my_diagnosis_26_years_later/,"I was 2 at diagnosis and spent the better part of a year going in and out of a pediatricians office having my grandparents (mom abandoned) told that it was nothing but a virus. I was rushed to children's hospital with a blood sugar somewhere in the 900's (can't remember exact number). That was 1996. I have controlled diabetic retinopathy now after being diagnosed at 22 after many, many, many tumultuous years of caring for myself and being in and out of the hospital and maintaining an A1C of ""off the charts"" at 14+ for the better part of a decade. I now treat my retinopathy every 12 weeks and have yet to discover any other major complications that require care such as kidney problems or neuropathy.. However, my emotional problems run very deep and I think that's a side of diabetes that doesn't receive enough attention. Our minds need extra care in the same way our bodies do. Our fluctuating blood sugars cause major emotional swings and whether you display them as depression, anxiety, anger or any other emotion, it can be hard to get people to understand that my moods can be very episodic and it's not because I suck, it's because I'm sick with an invisible illness that can make mood regulation difficult as BG's fluctuate. I try my best, and illness isn't an excuse to be an asshole, but receiving grace and understanding goes a long way when even I am confused by my own rapid cycling moods at times."

With my blood sugar normally going to 500 every day I am now paying the price for being misdiagnosed in a terrible way. After getting a new doctor (and surprise) finding out I am actually type 1 I struggled keeping things in control even with the help of insulin. About a year ago I got approved for the tslim and Dexcom and that shit has completely changed my life. Side note; after I found out I was type 1 I was very upset at the first doctor who misdiagnosed me and decided to pay him a visit. When I got there it turns out he had died because he had cancer that he didn’t know about. Only tho g I could think was what a shitty doctor.

Since my Type 1 diagnosis I was put on insulin pens. I could never get my blood sugar under control. I was constantly chasing highs and lows. My average blood sugar was 223. I hated myself. I thought I failed myself. I was in a dark place because I was trying so hard and wasn't getting anywhere. I blamed myself and was in a dark place ready to give up.

Fast forward to 3 weeks ago, I got my first pump, the Tandem T:Slim. Since then, I've had complete control of my levels.  My average blood sugar is 110 (I know it's not perfect BUT ILL TAKE IT).

Fast forward to 3 weeks ago, I got my first pump, the Tandem T:Slim. Since then, I've had complete control of my levels.  My average blood sugar is 110 (I know it's not perfect BUT ILL TAKE IT).

I'm writing this for anyone who is struggling, blaming themselves even though you're trying. There are tools that can help you, it's just a matter of finding them.

I just simply went to the pharmacist, and said, can I get a vial of NovoLog (Novorapid north of the border). 

You might want to bring some sort of cooler to keep the insulin happy. You may also consider a letter from your physician that you are a type one diabetic and taking XYZ medication.

You can call novolog straight up about their different programs they have. 1-844-Novo4Me (1-844-668-6463)

Afrezza Insulin has different programs you can [View here](https://afrezza.com/savings-program/)

Also - if you are game to switch brands of Insulin - sanofi brand Insulin has good programs available (I’ve taken both apidra and admelog for short term from them)

https://www.teamingupfordiabetes.com/sanofidiabetes-savings-program

Humalog/ Lilly also has a patient assistance program you can try. To me humalog and novolog are Interchangeable but YMMV.

You can also check with state Medicaid and look into the healthcare.gov for Insurance plans in the mean time. If you are under income (it’s much higher  than I expected too) you can get your Insurance subsidized through the federal government.

If you have just left a job or lost Insurance coverage - look into COBRA - [COBRA information ](https://www.goodrx.com/insurance/health-insurance/cobra-health-insurance)

Many times doctors offices will give samples of insulin away as well. If you can, get your doc to write you a script for a couple extra bottles a filling so you can stockpile a bit if needed. 

Walmart sells R and NPH for $25 a bottle without a script in most states. They act differently than other medication but can work. Many, including myself, used these before the more modern Insulins were available but please do your research on how to use. 

Www.goodrx.com can help you look for cheaper places around you. May not be cheap, but can possibly help you find a cheaper place.

Buying insulin outside the US,"Insulin is too expensive! These companies are literally killing us. Have you seen the list of diabetics dead from rationing insulin? I google insulin prices and see average figures for a vial of insulin in the ballpark of $16 in Mexico. Cheaper in other places. Then you google pharmacies and try to get it shipped, only to have the listed prices be substantially higher than that. What’s the secret? How do I get the $16 insulin? Tell me where it is and I’ll get on a plane. I’ll go trudging through the some low income( I almost said 3rd world, but it’s my country where the insulin is inaccessible ) slum. Is it in Mexico, Canada, Europe; I see $6 a vial in Kenya. I’ll go and bring you some back if you tell me where it is. Does the insulin have a different name?

Can't recall the model numbers or the year. I think the last one I used was the 670.  I stayed with Medtronic/Minimed for a long time then in maybe 2018 I switched to the tslim x2 and Dexcom G6 and LOVED it.  Then last Nov (2022) I switched to Omnipod 5... I had tried the Dash but hated it because it didn't have an auto control system. But when they released the Omni 5 I decided to try it. I absolutely love being tubeless, however I don't like the fact that I need a separate device to control the pump. With Minimed and tslim I got so used to having the control all in one unit but you have to disconnect for showers, swimming,hot tub. The tslim x2 is pretty compact though.
I've been waiting for the Omni 5 compatibility with the Dexcom G7 but according to the company it could take another year. So I've been considering going back to the tslim once they get compatibility w/the G7 since it'll be sooner.  BUT now there is a new option - BetaBionics iLet insulin pump compatible with Dexcom G6. It's a tubed pump with automatic insulin dosing. You only enter your body weight, no basal or bolus rates, no corrections, no carb counting. Sounds scary I know but according to the results of the clinical trials the algorithm is really fast in learning the user's insulin needs. You charge it with a Qi charger and it uses an infusion set. Technically it's waterproof so you may be able to keep wearing it in water. I'm pretty sure the app is available for both iPhone and Android.  I've decided to try the iLet pump once I know if my insurance will cover it.

With the Omni 5 and Dexcom G6 my last A1c was 6.1. It seems like each time I switch to a new one, my control gets better but it could be due to my greater attn to detail with the new system. I would give most of the credit to the Dexcom CGM. When I switched from Minimed to Tslim my A1c improved quite a bit. Minimed uses their own CGM and now has the Minimed 780 pump and Guardian 4 CGM.   It's being touted as very accurate. 
One other thing to consider is the closed loop system's blood glucose target. I believe both the Tslim and Minimed now allow you to set it as low as 100, whereas the Omni 5 is set at 110."

For me, I noticed mine tend to under read by about 10%. For example my BG test will be 140 and the sensor will be 125.  

In support groups for the 780 I've seen others say the opposite (they are low and their sensor reads higher).  So I think it's merely seeing how your interstitial fluid individually reacts to the sensors.   

Might have something to do with the sites people use too, I only use my arm and it's consistent.

But now that I've gotten that familiarity I'm able to do much more accurate dosing and more patient with on-board insulin."

Actually I was in the process of ordering a tslim and dexcom system when my Minimed rep called and said the 780 had been approved lol it was funny timing."

Hi everyone, I've had a rough 24 hours. I have not been able to keep my blood sugar down within my usual range for the life of me. The last 24 hours, my numbers have mostly stayed 170+, which is quite unusual for me. Correction doses seem to have little to no effect. When I finally do correct enough, it stays down for a bit before rising again. See pics for details. This morning, I woke up to 160 and it has risen to 208 now without me eating. Any ideas or insight as to what could be behind this? Thanks in advance.

With all three positive if you’re not strictly a T1 then you’d sooner extremely likely be a LADA than a T2 at any rate. (Which I doubt, you sound like a T1D based on current info) However, pretty much all T1’s go through a phase called the honeymoon phase. Your pancreas isn’t quite dead yet and it rather randomly still produces insulin, fighting the good fight. This can take weeks to months, but the end story is the same: it ends up dead (or well, the beta cells do). With LADA, this process is the same but it takes *a lot* longer. So you may do good on T2 meds first as a LADA; however, even T1’s in honeymoon can do alright on oral meds only for a while so that doesn’t say anything at all and your doctor should know better. 

Anyway, looking at the onset of your symptoms and requiring insulin from the get go: I’d classify you a T1D sooner than a LADA, but remotely diagnosing is impossible - hence the suggestion to try and get an answer from someone who isn’t challenged by a lack of knowledge on the subject; to put it mildly. Does your labwork show a c-peptide test anywhere by any chance? If so, what was the scale and what was the result?"

Autoantibody tests can confirm if you’re T1 and family care doctors don’t know heck about type 1. Your tests will show what you are and a doctors personal opinion doesn’t change that. Which is why an Endo should be able to confirm what type you are which really matters because treatments differ between types.

T2 usually doesn’t go from 0-100 like that and quite frankly LADA and MODY typically don’t either. (Plus T2 whilst positive on all antibodies isn’t something I’ve heard of before (bar LADA, but that ain’t T2), but that doesn’t necessarily say much :P)

Your development of symptoms and the progression strongly suggests T1D and currently in a honeymoon phase. Considering proper treatment is very important, I’d really try to get to a proper endocrinologist so you can get a clear and well-substantiated diagnoses of what type you are. The comment “you do well on metmorfin + insulin so you can’t be a T1” is a joke… Even if it turns out to be T2, that’s still a ridiculous thing to say and would be sheer luck they guessed the type right."

In my state you can immediately get a decision on medicaid - we just did for my brother, he turned 26 on the 28th and Friday was the last day of his insurance (should go through the last day of the month you turn 26 - I'm assuming that's your issue now too). It took 3-4 days to get his approval, choose his policy, and get his insurance card, but it all went pretty quickly. Each state handles things differently, but you should be able to apply using a similar process. 

Getting in to see an endo will be the bigger challenge. Under most insurance plans, you will need a referral from one of their doctors, and then waits can be long (typically 1-3 months). If you can stick with your current insurance company, this may streamline the process, but unfortunately, we don't have enough doctors and specialists to get the level of care we should. 

If you must wait on approval, start researching the insurance options you have to choose from. Try to find a doctor who will accept the insurance plan you will go with and see if you can book an appointment. You can explain your situation to the receptionist and see if they can book you for cash payment and switch it to your insurance if you can get everything set up in time (completed sign-up, required referrals, etc). 

As long as you are on insulin and able to keep blood sugars under reasonable control, you should be fine. Many T1s are sent home from the hospital, taking just enough insulin to keep them out of the hospital, and can wait months to see an endo today. Being high for a while won't cause significant damage, as long as you can get the care you need reasonably soon. Unfortunately, doctors are not great with adult diagnoses, so patients often don't get an ideal level of care.

When you see your new primary care doctor (even if you stick with the same insurance I would recommend using the opportunity to change physicians) take copies of your antibody test results, c-peptide tests, and other results to show them. Yes, its in your chart, but your doctor only has minutes to look at it, and your current doctor's notes are likely to make them expect T2. Have the proof on hand to show them you are T1 (or possibly T1.5 - though your diagnosis sounds much more like T1).

I hope that your insurance comes through quickly (even 1 day without insurance is too long as a diabetic, especially a newer one without years of experience and backups of all supplies) and that you can get the care you need soon. Good luck"

And yeah I just turned 21 and it’s because my parents didn’t file their renewal paperwork with Medicaid. So I had to file by myself. And I live in Arkansas and so far what DHS told me was that through the mail was my best bet. Since what they do is just scan it in and send it to them. But they’ve had a huge influx of ppl apparently so it may take a sec for approval. I’m not entirely sure how to even check on the status of it yet. I did just file on the 28th so it’s been a week at this point. Hopefully I get something soon. Thank you again!

They usually start with a mild one and then go up in dose and/or switch to something stronger if needed.

Dramatic 30x increase in ISF/CF caused very severe lows - ideas?,"
My 6 yo kiddo’s CF was 100 with MDI, that was changed to 120 when we put him on the op5 last week.

First day or two with the pump was fine but at some point it seems like his insulin sensitivity factor (correction factor) inexplicably increased a whopping 25-30x.

2-3 days back he had a severe stubborn crash from 250 to 45 even though we started treating him at 90. He did turn around eventually but it took a hell lot of carbs. The dose we had given him was only 0.2 units…

After we recovered, we saw that 0.05 units was causing a drop in BG of 100-150 points. Very erratic reaction to insulin dosing, but spike after carbs was typical.

Yesterday, he needed more insulin and seemed that his CF was a little lower. Today, few hours back though, CF has dropped back to near normal levels. Now 1 unit is bringing it down by 100-150 points.

Has anybody seen the ISF change so drastically and suddenly before?

Some observations:
1. This started around the time we went to the pump from MDI. 
2. We use Lily brand lispro in a vial in the pump instead of the kids humalog with the kwikpen. 
3. He did have a whole body allergic rash around the same time we went to the pump. A similar rash has happened a month ago too though when we were on MDI but his CF hadn’t changed this much back then.
4. No changes in his diet or activity level.
5. It could be honeymoon phase but weird that it would start/stop so suddenly and dramatically 2-3 months into diagnosis.

My suspicion is - could his body be having  a hyper sensitive reaction to insulin during those past couple days, perhaps related to the allergic rash? Or was the rash unrelated?

I’m worried his CF may dramatically increase again in future unexpectedly and cause him to have a severe low again. So would like to get to the bottom of this if any ideas.

Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14nr9v6/dramatic_30x_increase_in_isfcf_caused_very_severe/,"You need much less insulin with a pump compared to MDI. But you can also dose smaller doses with it. So, I would work with a reduced correction factor and higher target goal for now.

Especially with children unfortunately there is a lot variety in insulin needs, also connected to all the growing hormones doing their work. With a pump and a CGM it is easier to observe and react accordingly. Also I recommend to be a bit more careful with BG corrections from a higher level, the CGM can be pretty inaccurate in that area. 

Remission phase can also play a role, it can happen a few months after diagnosis."

a couple of questions as a newly diagnosed t1,"Hello everyone!! 
A couple of questions
I believe I might be going through a bit of a honeymoon phase but Im not sure. The past few days I’ve been 100% in range, and since I started the dexcom it’s been around 85% in range with a couple of small highs here and there (never above 13) is that normal? I haven’t had a single low yet and I’ve been diagnosed since 27th may, despite me being very careless with my dosing sometimes.
For example the other day I injected 5 units of my rapid insulin, and then did not eat anything. (I know this is a bad idea I just wanted to see what happens) My levels were sitting around 8 or 9 before I did that, and barely came down afterwards, maybe sitting at about 6 like 3 hours later.
Sometime I just feel like I don’t even have t1d and they just messed up the tests or something. But I’ve confirmed with all my doctors, I definitely have the antibodies for t1d. Am I in denial? I don’t know. 
I also wanted to know if anybody struggles with an eating disorder on top of all of this? I struggled for YEARS with binge eating, purging, restricting but finally had gotten it all under control, and had a somewhat healthy relationship with food and my body, and the other day I had a proper appointment with a dietician who really went into depth into carb counting and gave me set amounts and I have fallen off the deep end. To be honest, I don’t know what to do. I’m struggling with everything so much and i guess nobody around me really understands the severity of it.

Does diabetes cause you to overeat?,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14nf9kl/does_diabetes_cause_you_to_overeat/,There is a blood test and it can be addressed with hormone replacement. I discovered it accidentally in myself when I gained about 30 lbs after diagnosis and my doctor suggested we try a glp-1 agonist since I'm still making a small amount of insulin and it's a common pairing in Europe for Lada patients. Most people have talked about no longer having food noise on these meds and I suddenly have normal hunger cues again. After speaking to my Endo we suspect the issue was an Amylin deficiency - which we can't test for now but is a normal part of diabetic - since Amylin is also produced in the pancreas. Some of us are just impacted more than others I've learned.
Libre freestyle 2 vs dexcom 6?,I’m switching from the Libre 2 (4weeks use) to the dexcom g6 prior to starting omnipod. I’m looking for all experiences and opinions.

The advantages of a pump over MDI far outweigh the benefits you may get by the libre 2 over the g6.

Also keep in mind that you could always use the pump in manual mode and if you do, you could use any cgm you want - libre2/3 or g6/g7 as well.

Finally, you may want to look into DIY loop which allows you to use more cgms in closed loop than the stock op app"

Many years ago when I was in my 20's I travelled to Thailand with some friends. I had done so much research on a ""waterproof case"" for the pump I had (Medtronic 520 or something at the time?). I remember going to pool parties, having the time of my life with my buddies for a few nights. And then at one party this literal child came up to me and said ""You're beeping!"" after I jumped out of a massive pool party with probably hundreds of people at it.

Maybe just an alarm or something? Nope. Fatal error. Water damage. Pump never worked again. Had already had it for 5+ years so no warranty. Luckily I had brought a travel backup pump from Medtronic (Free to do, by the way, but has to be returned within 90 days). I used the backup for the rest of the trip and when I got home and told my story to a bunch of friends and family they decided to GoFundMe a new one and sent it to everyone I knew. Raised like $5500 within 24hrs. New pump was around $7500 at the time. Insane and will never forget people's generosity for my own problems.

It was an expensive $2000 lesson but, could have been a lot worse. Don't trust Waterproof cases."

So, here is a friendly reminder for my fellow pumpers to disconnect *before* enjoying the water this summer!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14mp5yr/a_very_wet_misfortune/,"I remember my first paradigm pump being marketed for swimming. I was a 5th grader with a pool in her yard-I swam CONSTANTLY. Then one day I put it back on and heard the plunger whirring, went to my mom and she yells “rip it off rip it off!!” It had given me an unknown amount of insulin as the water caused it to malfunction. I don’t remember details other than my mom panicking because we had no idea how much insulin to correct for, but I did get to have kool-aid that day lol. A few weeks later they sent out a notice that they were absolutely NOT to be used while swimming. 

Glad it worked out OP, but man how scary!"
A Very Wet Misfortune,"Well…I finally did the thing I have always been so careful about not doing; I jumped into the pool with my pump connected. I don’t know how I didn’t realize, and, even worse, it was about 10 minutes of floating bliss before my arm rubbed against it and I had an immediate panic attack (not much of an exaggeration). I quickly dried it off and frantically googled, hoping for good news. According to the Tandem website, the pump is water resistant up to 3 feet/30 minutes. I was about 1/3 of the time and the depth (small celebration). I then found several people who apparently do all types of water sports in them and never have issues! *relief* 

About 90 minutes later, I went to put it back on- malfunction. A fatal malfunction. Instant tears at the thought of the nearly $4k it cost a year ago, which was only possible thanks to the generosity of my grandmother, and would not be attainable again for several months, at minimum. This pump has changed my life y’all. I was so resistant for years (more resistant than the pump, apparently), and finally gave in, wishing I had done so sooner.

I have sorta a similar situation. My doctors are still unsure what type I have.  At the moment, I am just a pre-diabetic.

I never had an issue with blood sugar until after I was administered the C Vaccine. After the V, I became very sick and noticed frequent urination, thirst, and weird blurred vision.  I get blood work down often and noticed my fasting glucose was increasing every few months. Normally, my fasting blood sugars are in the 50-70s with no symptoms of hypoglycemia. Now, they are in the predibetic range and increasing despite fasting, no carbs, and exercise. My labs are showing a decrease in insulin production and an increase in A1c. I think I have LADA or Type 1.5. My endo doesn't want to say I am type II, because I am very thin, athletic, and eat very well.  He doesn't want to say I am type1 either, because I am producing just enough insulin for him to say it is not type 1.

I am just stuck in between.

I know this all started with the V, so I believe yours could have started with COVID.

Oh! Just remembered! A woman at my job was diagnosed with type 1.5 after being sick with COVID. He also told me he is seeing an increase in people with diabetes and autoimmune diseases. After the V, I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's. It was all triggered by the V and probably COVID."

In 2021 I was told that I had T2. So I told my Dr that I was going to fight it and take care of T2 without meds. She gave me two months to see what I could do. This was in January. I totally changed my diet and started walking everyday.  The weight flew off and I felt so good. I was so proud of myself for working so hard. I was 49 years old 5'3"" and started at 157 pounds. My eye site started to get bad and I was l getting some pain in my hips but I racked that up to age and exercising. Then I started to get so thirsty and tired. Still figured it was exercise. Then on March 6th I was falling asleep while playing video games and I was so so thirsty and my hips hurt so bad. I was down to 120 pounds and thought that maybe it has something to do with my Hashimoto's. Maybe a thyroid storm? Went to ER pretty much could not keep my eyes open. They finally got me back to see Dr and my BG was so high they could not measure it! I was rushed to the ICU because I was in DKA and going onto a coma! I was in ICU for 4 days and they didn't diagnose me as T1D. But I have excellent drs who checked my blood and sure enough, T1D! We think my month long bout with covid triggered it."

I was diagnosed in September 2022, after I was sick with COVID. I am the only one in my family with Type 1, everyone else who has diabetes is either pre-diabetic or type 2. I was wondering if anyone else had a similar situation to mine?

I also have a story I find funny that I'd like to share. My girlfriend is a nursing student currently, and prior to my diagnosis, I was experiencing symptoms like extreme thirst and frequent urination. She was doing a simulation lab, and her simulated patient, who was diabetic, was experiencing the exact same thing I was. I remember talking to her about it and laughing it off, saying things like ""I doubt it"" and ""There's no way"". Well, there was a way.

freestyle libre 3 app issues,"i was just switching over my sensors and the app would just not allow me to scan the new one. i closed the app out multiple times and it still didn’t work so i deleted and redownloaded the app. i assumed since i have a log in the data would still be there but now it’s all gone and i’m so annoyed. 

is there anyway to get the data back and has anyone else experienced the “scan new sensor” button not working?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14nchas/freestyle_libre_3_app_issues/,based on other reddit posts im guessing the data can’t be recovered but FUCK why wont the stupid button work

Comparing Dexcom g7 and Medtronic,,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/14nc4x6,"I’m having the opposite happen - MM is far closer to what my actual blood tests are showing by at least 20-30 points, especially when I’m in that higher range.  This could also be due to where the sensors are - guardian is in my abdomin, g7 is in my arm. 
I’m getting better at reading the dots, but there’s definitely more trending information on the guardian than dexcom so far.  

OTOH the actually important alerts and ability to get info on my watch are fantastic.  There’s less noise and CONSTANT buzzing from the dexcom."
Clinical Trials,"Hello all,

I am reaching out to the community to inquire about clinical trials. 

I know very little about the process of what's involved. I'm wondering what information anyone might have regarding alternative treatments to Type 1 Diabetes. 

Also, does anyone have information about Type 1 in other countries and perhaps what alternative treatments they might be using to manage? 

I've lived with Type 1 since 1993. I'm 38 years old and live in California. I AM SO TIRED OF NEEDLES. I am so tired of the pain. I struggle with retinopathy as a complication among other nerve issues. 

To be fair, I'm reasonably healthy and could certainly have caused myself more issues had I not come to my senses later in life.

Occasionally I’ll have a run where it hurts or bleeds/bruises but the actual sites themselves almost never fail. 

My preference overall is any inset that doesn’t have an inserter like the Tandem VariSoft or Medtronic Silhouette. I have a harder time maintaining 90° insertion angle sites other than the Medtronic Quickset."

After two years (some people it takes longer) my body started rejecting it. It put me in the hospital 3x because I couldn't stop profusely vomiting for days. From what my dr told me they are starting to see this a lot with people on Ozempic not to mention muscle weakness. I switched to Trulicity and haven't had any issues with the same benefits. Please keep in mind once you start these types of meds you can't just stop. If you so you will need 3x as much insulin as you needed before (from experience). Good luck to you!"

Sliding scale diabetes management whilst in hospital,I’m type 1 diabetic. In hospital for spine surgery. Had first surgery on Tuesday & they let me manage my own injections. I felt good. But now I need a second surgery & they put me on an insulin/glucose sliding scale in an iv drip. It’s keeping my blood glucose in the 6’s and 7’s. (Don’t know how that equates to USA readings). But I feel awful on it. Being constantly given glucose then insulin depending on my hourly blood glucose reading. Has anyone had experience of this? Thank you,https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14mc4sx/sliding_scale_diabetes_management_whilst_in/,"I would say bring it up with your doctor honestly. As I understand it, when you are going to have surgery, having a high will increase your risk of a infection, prolonged stays in the hospital, and potentially even death. The intent of Sliding Scale, or VRIII(Variable Rate Intravenous Insulin Infusion) as it's ""officially"" called, is to minimize the likelihood of any potential chance of high BG when a patient is in a situation where their BG numbers will be unusually variable, like a diabetic hospital patient needing to minimize eating before a surgery. The amount of fluids in your body can also have an impact on the surgery and how your body handles it, so it isn't just glucose being given but also other ""body maintenance fluids"" so that when you go to the operating table, you 100% without any question aren't dehydrated or lacking in any specific thing your body needs like potassium.

Though I just want to double check, but you do genuinely mean the 6-7 range, and not 16-17 correct? In mg/dl, that's about the 110-126 range, which is within the recommended range for type 1s if a bit on the upper end, being 4.5-7.2. The target range for Sliding Scale is actually 6-10 though, meaning you are within the ideal target range, if a bit on the lower side. Unless you are meaning that it isn't ""feeling too high/low"" that's bothering you, but the roller coaster of rising and falling constantly due to the IV? I know how a rapid rise and fall can hit you like a truck, so if you're rather sensitive to that sensation, I'd imagine it must feel terrible. 

Like I said, I'd genuinely bring up how you are feeling with your doctor. If it's what I mentioned before, that the IV is repeatedly over-correcting highs, then over-correcting lows and repeating, that's a sign the system isn't being used properly. If that isn't the reason you feel bad, well you still feel bad which means *somethings* going on. I'd try to get some time to speak with the doctor, or head nurse, or whoever's in charge of your stay and let them know that you are feeling unwell, with it possibly being due to the VRIII. I'd make sure to ask about *why* they have you on VRIII so that if they are receptive and are willing to genuinely listen to you, you can work out some sort of change to the system like how much it will deliver, or maybe even go back to personal management. 

There's likely some sort of form you could request that lets you go back to personal management, with the note that if anything bad does happen, you signing the form means you can't blame the hospital for it. If you feel confident enough that you can genuinely manage your own sugars to the requirements the hospital wants you to be in pre-surgery, that's an option to ask about.

Though ultimately I'm just some dude online, so take my advice with a bucket of salt. The best solution for almost any problem involving other people is communication. Let the people watching over you know how you are feeling, let them know what you are worried about, and try to work with them to find an outcome that is ideal for both you and them."

But it does feel like I’m going from high to low over & over. It’s 125 ml/hr of 4% glucose & 2 ml/hr of insulin. Latest blood glucose 4.5 so they just adjusted it to 1 ml/hr insulin. So now I get to zoom up again. It’s been 4 hrs and the operation keeps being delayed. I moaned about feeling lousy and they said it’s just till after the operation so there is hopefully an end in sight!

Here in Sweden it is either 4-10 or 4-9.something (I forget exactly). When I was diagnosed in the UK it was 4-9.

Also being in that range isn't everything. If it is isn't level, more going up and down, due to the adding insulin and then correcting with glucose, it can make you feel quite exhausted.

Unfortunately I doubt they will do much about it. With such a serious surgery as spinal they will probably prioritise healing over how the patient feels."

They initially said they would be back to check it in an hour and I raged and said you will stop this immediately and treat me with glucose. I could have a comma if you leave me for an hour still on the bloody machine with and extreme hypo! So they did half an hour later after doctors approval and me feeling like I was dying. But then they turned it on again when I’d gone back up to 9.6. Thankfully the surgeon popped in whilst I was recovering from the low to say surgery has it’s been postponed till tomorrow due to an emergency case and they will reassess me at 6am. So now I’m having tea and toast. Have to go nill by mouth again  at 2 am

Canadian programs for insulin costs?,"Hi all! I’ve been a type 1 diabetic for like 4 ish years now, I’m 26, and I just lost my job, aka my benefits. 

Do you know of any government programs (or any other things too) that pay for insulin / arm sensors? 

I’m located in southern Ontario (in Canada) so currently ADP covers most of my omnipod costs so I’m not worried about that, it’s my Freestyle Libre 2 & my novorapid insulin vials that are expensive and have no coverage now. I’ve never had to pay for supplies at full cost before and I can’t afford it bc EI pays nothing and i still don’t have a new job yet. also I’m not covered by OHIP anymore because I’m over 25. 

If you know of any programs or whatever please let me know.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14msujg/canadian_programs_for_insulin_costs/,"The Trillium drug program is based on your income and covers the Libre as well as biosimilar insulins to brand name ones. Novorapid won't be covered, but biosimilar insulin aspart is.

You will pay 4% of your income as a deductible, then after that, no more than $2 ""per drug"" but I'm not sure if they'll base if off your past income or current.

You may be able to purchase at shoppers and stack with PC Optimum points using the app on any portion unpaid. I'm not sure if it's allowed for prescriptions, but it is if you buy over the counter. I used to buy Libre over the counter on 20x bonus point days (which is 30% back in points) and then once I had accumulated 200 000 pc points ($200 worth) I'd wait for a redemption deal where I get $300 off my purchase when redeeming 200k points. Insulin and syringes can be bought this way as well. This is more of a long haul game but might as well start earning the points just in case. You can buy other stuff at shoppers to increase your point earnings. 3 Libres and 4 packs of insulin pens should get to close to 200k points for example, and then you'll essentially be able to able to get 2 libres and a pack of insulin free. I use pens so I'm not sure how much vials cost but theyll probably be cheaper. Libres are $120 at shoppers but you get the points to use later. Check my post history for a breakdown. 

Costco also has cheaper Libres I've read (80 to 90$).

Hope this will help tie you over until you get approved for the program/get a new job with benefits."

I’m gonna cry,https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14mim40/please_give_advice_on_staying_in_target_range/,"An 8.2 a1c is equivalent to a average bg of 180.  I don't think an 8.2 is \_that\_ bad, especially if there isn't crazy variation.

That said, what's the gear you are using? MDI? Pump? GCM? Something like a Tslim or Omnipod 5 should get you closer to 7 without much effort. Are you in the US? Or what's your country's policy on pumps?  


There's no need to do low carb if you have good ratios for basal / IC / etc. especially if it's going to cause you more frustration."

I’m gonna cry,https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14mim40/please_give_advice_on_staying_in_target_range/,"Sorry to hear you’re having a rough night! I’ve been there and days like that are no fun. There’s some good advice but I think the biggest thing is honestly just figuring out your body and what works best for you. 

Do some basal testing. Make sure your overnight basal is correct. When my a1c was in the mid 7s I was frusturated because my daytime numbers were awesome. So much of our day is subsequently overnight so if time in range isn’t there overnight it’s not going to matter as much how your blood sugar is during the day. Your a1c will be higher if your night numbers are higher. 

If you have a cgm great! If not, highly recommend. My cgm has allowed me to take my a1c from the 7s to the low to mid 5s. Mainly because I’ve been able to really figure out how food affects me. Chocolate crossiants? Love them. Before I’d spike to 300 and come crashing down. Now because I know how I react to them I can usually peak at 180 and land smoothly. It’s really valuable. Also- it taught me I really over treat lows. I found most of the time I need 4-8 grams of carbs. Occasionally I need 15-20 but unless I’m aggressively dropping, I start more moderate and see where I’m at in 15.

Prebolusing really is your best friend. With a cgm you can figure out what timing works best for you. 

Lastly the biggest tool I use is movement. My diabetes is actually a lot more predictable if I commit to some daily movement. I like working out but not everyday. I’ve basically committed to myself at least a half hour walk a day. It’s good for me and it helps keep me sensitive so I don’t worry about low carb."

(Butternut squash and sweet potato some people include I know among others) but the thing I’m not getting is how many carbs is low carb? Do you mind sharing how many g of carb you roughly eat a day? And if you’re eating low carb, do you bolus for protein and fat? If I’m eating something with 15-20g of protein, and 15g of carbs, I can’t just bolus for the carbs. My blood sugar will be high. I find that I have to bolus for the protein too so if I’m bolusing for carbs AND protein and maybe even fat, the blouses will be a lot of insulin. My ratio is 1:6. I’ve seen some people on here comment that a steak and veggies will only be 1 unit of insulin to cover their meal which to me literally makes no sense being that a 6oz steak has about 40g of protein and fat content that your body will turn into glucose. Do you mind sharing how many minutes before a meal you bolus, and if and how you bolus for the fat and protein? I’m taking humalog now and I know it’s very fast acting, so timing matters because fat and protein digest slower and peak later in the blood than carbs do. So that’s also throwing me off. And maybe if you don’t mind sharing some sample meals of what you eat in a day? I always read the back labels on foods and check the carbs fats and proteins. Because if you’re low carb you need higher fat and protein for sustenance. I apologize I’m sure you’re very busy this is just confusing as heck. I’m at a loss here.

For example, someone eats 60g of carb a day so 20g at every meal, they need to up their protein and fat. Confusing part is, do they just bolus for the 20g of carbs not the fat and protein? If the meal is high protein let’s say 30g and maybe 15g of fat, I’d think more than likely you need to bolus for them because your body will turn them into sugar/energy. That means you end up taking a lot of insulin for the 3 macros. Or, the other side, don’t fill up on leafy greens and veg and low glycemic berries like black berries, which are around 6g of carb, and then bolus for the protein and fat only. Which will result in less insulin used. It’s just all very confusing I don’t know how to approach this diet/lifestyle. 😔"

One thing scientists are good at is trying to either tweak something another scientist found didn't work or by trying to reproduce the same results in the same way. It is all slow. We have a lot of progress not because of scientific lottery moments but rather because scientists keep slogging away and we have a lot of scientists.

Post meal rise,Hi everyone.  So something new that looks to be happening to my 8yo t1d son is a significant rise starting an hour or hour and a half after the meal.  He ate at 12 today with a 10 min prebolus.  Looks like it was going great and then the rise happened.  Happens with every meal.  This has never happened before unless he had some really fatty like pizza or French fries.  It's the same lunch he's been eating for a long time now.  Any thoughts?  Thanks!,https://i.redd.it/yginhua4109b1.jpg,"Use an extended bolus and spread the insulin delivery out over a longer time.  Start with say, 50% up front and the other 50% over the next hour.  Adjust the ratio as necessary.


Also, you might want to change that high glucose alarm to a lower value so you can take action to correct it sooner."

Thanks!,https://i.redd.it/yginhua4109b1.jpg,"How long has your son been diagnosed? And what kind of insulin are you using? 

I think for most kids on humalong / novalog, a 10 minute pre bolus is not nearly enough, I generally would like to see a drop off at dose time and then a quick rise. the lack of a significant drop on this graph at 12 noon indicates that perhaps the pre bolus isn't long enough.

If your son was recently diagnosed, the issue could be that honeymoon is ending and you need to adjust to post honeymoon diabetes.

How old is the pod? We typically see less responsive insulin on day 3 (and on a new pod) vs a pod that is 6-60 hours in use.

Do you have a graph for the basal? With Loop (Omnipod but not o5) we run into this issue a lot when basal gets suspended for more than an hour. 

What was the lunch? are you sure your timings are accurate? I think it's pretty odd that a 8 year old eating at 12 noon would have a BG that is trending down until 1 p.m. That could make O5 ""think"" the lunch bolus was ""too strong"" and cause it to turn off he basal.

Even if the lunch was not pizza, that trendline is indicative of a higher fat meal which is digesting slowly. It could also be the the dexcom is giving less than accurate reading (maybe the transmitter is close to 90 days)? 

In general, meals should spike to 140-160 (even with O5) post eating (like 15-30 minutes after commencing eating), unless they are super low carb. If the meal doesn't spike it generally indicates the meal bolus is too strong (or there is an issue with the dexcom)"

As far as alarm, I'm aware of his bg pretty much all the time unless I'm sleeping.   He went up to 220 before I did a small bolus and he's coming back down now.  It's so strange, like he started digesting carbs a lot slower or something."

Still have the evening high a couple hours after dinner...but that's been happening off and on since diagnosis.  Probably hormones and/or fatty meals some days.

It happens.  I can eat the same food with the same bolus and it comes out perfect, but there's always that one time where it sends my numbers into orbit and I can't figure out why.

Also some people get accustomed to certain insulins - my daughter started having lots of weird readings on Humalog so we switched to Novolog and are day 3 issues when away. But now we are on FIASP and the day 3 issues are back (even though FIASP is just Novolog + b3 vitamins!)

That flat line for a meal is pretty impressive, what are you doing food wise? 

On the post dinner rise, I don't know why this isn't better known, but BG / insulin needs are totally age dependent and for kids, there is a marked increase in insulin needs post bedtime thru the early morning hours. 

[https://diatribe.org/rules-engagement-basal-insulin-adjustment-or-avoiding-basal-blunders](https://diatribe.org/rules-engagement-basal-insulin-adjustment-or-avoiding-basal-blunders)

Dawn phenomenon is predominantly an adult issue.  My daughter goes from needing around .8-.9 units during the day to needing 1.4 units or more between 9 and midnight. (she's 9). So the evening high after dinner is totally normal, I'm not sure how the 05 algo handles kids, but I suppose you could cheat it a little and enter some phantom carbs at bedtime. But larger issue is, that rise is totally to be expected with an 8 year old, annoying that the omnipod5 doesn't handle it."

I think this gets back to O5 borrowing future basal to pay for bolus now. Like if you bolus 5 units and your basal rate is 1 unit per hour, O5 might bolus 5 or a bit more and then suspend / cut basal to keep you in range and adjust basal as needed.

There's also a good amount of fat in the PB + milk and chips which probably slows the digestion down.

Also, at the pre bolus, what's the typical BG? having a higher BG at pre bolus also helps with automated systems as the system is more willing to give a larger bolus if it thinks you are unlikely to be out of range soon (one of the ""downsides"" with Loop is it is very easy to sit in the 80-low 90s which makes bolusing hard)."

Ask your endo to write the script for changing the pod every 2 days - mine suggested this to me so I think it's pretty well known in the endo world that pods don't always last 3 days. Also nice to have extra pods.

I still like to pull the 80 hour pod now and then, but when in doubt, change the pod.

You might want to see if they have an extra vial of humalog to see if that performs better on day 3 (most insurance you can pay a bit extra for the nonapproved insulin, I think for us it's 120 vs 90 for a 3 month supply and for kids we only need to refill 2x a year so and extra 60 bucks for day 3 pod usage was worth it).

what kind of a1c are you getting on Omnipod5? that graph looks great for a ""problem day"" lol"

"False lows when laying on my back, see comments",,https://i.redd.it/44bt7kyzxz8b1.png,"I have the sensor on my upper arm.  Not the back, more toward the inside.  I’m mostly a side sleeper and I’m pretty good about sleeping on the side that doesn’t have the sensor.  Sometimes I end up on my back and this has been happening with my current sensor.  When I’m on my back the sensor is free & clear, nothing pressing on it at all.  As soon as I turn on my side again it returns to normal.  This hasn’t happened to me before and I find it to be really weird."
"False lows when laying on my back, see comments",,https://i.redd.it/44bt7kyzxz8b1.png,Compression lows. Roll.
"False lows when laying on my back, see comments",,https://i.redd.it/44bt7kyzxz8b1.png,Can’t be.  There was absolutely nothing touching the sensor.
"False lows when laying on my back, see comments",,https://i.redd.it/44bt7kyzxz8b1.png,Compression lows don’t have to be from force on the sensor they can also be from stasis of interstitial fluid which is my guess what is happening here.
"False lows when laying on my back, see comments",,https://i.redd.it/44bt7kyzxz8b1.png,"It's so weird.  It drops immediately after I lay on my back and goes right back up if I go back to my side.  This is the first sensor that has done anything like this.  I know many people hate on Medtronic but I could sleep on those sensors all night without a problem, and they were very accurate for me too."

Why is my FreeStyle Libre 2 so inaccurate?,I don’t understand why there is such a big discrepancy in the readings from my Libre and my meter. It kept telling me I was low last night and I ended up waking up this morning at nearly 300. Anyone have any idea if this is a faulty Libre or what is going on? I haven’t been to impressed with this system to be honest.,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/14madza,"Option 1: You got a dodgy sensor. Call Abbott, tell them it’s not reading anywhere close to fingersticks (cite an example- it’s telling me I’m 65 and fingerstick says 180 etc) and ask for a replacement sensor.

Option 2: Is it your first day wearing the Libre? Cos the first day for me is always a bit wonky. It’ll either read low all night or high all night with no in between. (You can “pre-soak” a sensor by putting it on but not activating it 24 hours before your previous one dies. I don’t do this because I enjoy my few hours not being a cyborg, but it’s certainly an option)

Option 3: Those low alarms at night- are you laying on the sensor? Libre 2 suffers compression lows- if you lay on the sensor, the sensor can’t read interstitial fluid properly because there isn’t enough so it just shrieks at you and tells you that you are low."
