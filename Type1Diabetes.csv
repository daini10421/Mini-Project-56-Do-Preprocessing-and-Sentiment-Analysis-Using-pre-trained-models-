Coronavirus and T1D,"Edit 12/25 As of yesterday, I’m on my 3rd COVID diagnosis. I think I’ve just gotten unlucky (despite being vaccinated) and I’ve gotten all 3 variants lol

Hey y’all! I’m a type one, diagnosed 4ish years ago. I tested positive for coronavirus. I’m currently doing fine. But I wanted to post this, in case someone has concerns about coronavirus and it’s relation to diabetes. :) I want to be a resource for whoever needs it!

Edit:
How I got it: my dad had been sick during Easter weekend. But doctors told him he had a sinus infection. They went ahead and put an order in for him to get tested. I went back to my apartment near school. A few days later, the result cake back positive. So I knew I had been exposed. My mom also got sick. (They are currently recovering with no complications).

It would also probably be helpful to outline my symptoms and the whole timeline. So I will be updating this daily with any new symptoms.

I am currently on day 14 of symptoms.

Day 1: I had a weird mucousy cough. I have allergies so coughing is normal for me. But this felt different and it was a little more frequent. 

Day 2: I had a really bad headache along with the cough.

Day 3: I had a sore throat, the headache, and the cough. I also had joint pain. My doctor decided I should get tested because I had been directly exposed and I have diabetes. I went ahead and got tested that day. I took Tylenol to treat the headache and it worked fine.

Day 4: I just had a slight cough and a headache, but it wasn’t that bad. I started taking azithromycin to treat the respiratory symptoms. 

Day 5: I got my results and it was positive. I was told to complete the antibiotics, take Tylenol for the headache, take a prescription they gave me for the cough, and to continue taking multivitamins. 
At this point, I was able to feel my lungs if I took a deep breath. I compare it to the feeling you get when you run for a really long time. It’s like a slight pressure/cramp in your lungs. 
My old endocrinologist prescribed an inhaler (albuterol sulfate) just in case I end up needing it. 

Day 6: I had no bad symptoms. It’s mainly the symptom of feeling my lungs, coughing, and getting shortness of breath during talking a lot or walking around. I also lost my sense of smell and tastE for the most part.

Day 7: I have a cough, and pressure in my chest/lungs. I don’t know how I’d really describe it.

Day 8: I just have a cough and a little bit of pressure in my chest.

Day 9: I had a cough and my throat started feeling sore. My tonsils seem inflamed. My nose also has a burning sensation. It’s kind of weird to describe. 

Day 10: I have a cough. Same burning nose sensation. Shortness of breath. I lightly worked out with A LOT of breaks in between. 

Day 11: I have a cough and shortness of breath with tasks like going up stairs.

Day 12: I CAN SMELL AND TASTE AGAIN! I also talked to my nurse and she said because I haven’t had a fever in the last three days, my last positive test result was over a week ago, and my symptoms have improved, I no longer need to isolate from people in my house 🥳

Day 13: I feel great other than a cough. Slight shortness of breath.

Day 14: just a cough 🤩

I have had a spotted history of lung infections and in rare cases, pneumonia. I caught Covid-19 in the early days of the pandemic. I was sick for about a week and it passed without too much issue. My blood sugars during my battle with Covid-19 were unaffected, maybe even better than usual because I ate less.  I was sick, but still able to go about most daily activities without any problems. In the past, I have had flus and other infections send me to the hospital or at the very least have to use an inhaler for a short period of time while sick. I was lucky that Covid-19 wasn\'t effective at all against me. Testing didn\'t really exist at this time (it was early 2020), but I took multiple antibody tests later on that came back positive for Covid-19 infection. So, either this sickness was Covid-19 or I was completely asymptomatic when I was infected. That is HIGHLY unlikely based on how I react to most respiratory infections.\n\nAbout 7 months back, I was forced to get the Covid-19 vaccine by my ex employers under threat of termination. I opted for the J&J shot, because I figured it was just one dose and I\'d be rid of it. That ""vaccine"" lead to me being bed ridden for 3 weeks and having to visit the ER twice with severe breathing problems. It was by far the worst experience I have ever had with being sick. My blood sugars were wild, I wasn\'t eating, and my usually mild gastroparesis went absolutely nuts during this time and for about two months after recovery.  The gastroparesis also lead to me being unable to work for said ex employer which lead to them ""letting me go"". So, I was fired regardless.\n\nUp until very recently, I have been having heart problems as well as increased anxiety. My vision at a distance has also noticeably decreased within the last 6 months. My doctors at Kaiser Permanente kept saying its just complications with diabetes. Strange that I wouldn\'t have any issues at all, ever, until this incident...right after this shot...but I digress.\n\nI am now no longer with Kaiser Permanente as on January 1st and have joined a private practice. My gastro health has improved dramatically, I am working for a new company that allows working from home some days, and I have solid natural immunity despite the shot that almost killed me. I am on multiple natural supplements that have been scientifically proven to work against general infection and Covid-19 specifically. So far, I am having zero new issues and the issues that came from the shot have lessened dramatically. I am still having vision issues, but my heart problems have stopped and my anxiety is basically gone.\n\nAgain, don\'t know if this helps anyone, but I wanted to share my experience with Covid-19 being a diabetic. Maybe it\'ll stir up some conversation.', 'Thank you for doing this. I am sorry you got it happy you are better.', '&#x200B;\n\nKeep in mind your immune system is actually pretty solid if you are a type 1.

I need to rant!,"So I’m currently in hospital for something that isn’t related to my diabetes. I have relatively good control over my diabetes, even while I’ve been on and off steroid medication for another illness I’m battling. 

Why can’t the nurses understand basic Type 1 diabetes? How many times do I have to tell them that I don’t take my fast acting (Novorapid) at set times during the day? I’m not eating lunch until 1:30, why are you trying to get me to inject my insulin at 12?? 

One of the nurses even tried to tell me off for taking insulin for my dinner when I was 4.1! She said “that’s too low for taking any insulin, you shouldn’t take your insulin until it goes back to 12.0.” 

I had to explain that my normal range is between 5.0-9.0, but because I’m taking steroids again they’re running slightly higher and I was actually very pleased that my sugars had remained steady at 4.1. I further explained that 4.1 isn’t a hypo for me, sure it’s on the lower side but I was pretty chuffed with it! I then had to explain again that I’m about to eat my lunch, I NEED to have my insulin regardless or my sugars will spike too high. 

This nurse just couldn’t grasp this at all! 

Honestly the knowledge some nurses have of Type 1 is appalling. I understand not everyone has extensive knowledge of it, but this is just dangerous!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14w2p1v/i_need_to_rant/,"[""My little guy (2) was diagnosed in February. I sadly passed it along and have been type 1 for 28 years...the guilt kills me. We are in the hospital, and his blood sugar is 92, and he's nibbled on a couple slices of carrot, and  some chicken. The nurse comes in and just wants to blindly dose based on what the doctors told her to give at meals. I stopped her and said that he's at a normal range, and hasn't had any measurable amount of carbs, so don't give him insulin right now. She said she had to ask the doctor. She came back and said that no insulin right now was fine. I had to have a talk with them. If they had dosed without actually accounting for what he was eating, we'd be fighting a low in no time.

Health Insurance Advice,"Hey fellow diabetics.

HELP.

I am on Medicaid and I'm really sick of it. I'm sick of having to work limited hours and low paid jobs simply to qualify for income limits.

I want to work, save up, thrive. I don't want to have to destroy my RX coverage in order to do this. 

I'm on: Dexcom, Fiasp, Toujeo. I also obviously visit doctors and specialists. Paying large copays or paying out of pocket due to lack of coverage would hurt my health and finances. I'm so sick of having to choose. 

Can anyone share real life solutions they've found? Insurance plans that don't suck?  Maybe a large company with decent healthcare plans? I need to work remotely for a variety of reasons, and I'm just at the end of my rope. 

Has anyone found a non profit or something that helps people navigate this?  It's weird and hard to try to see EXACTLY what would be covered and what copays would cost....on a job interview.

Mail-Order Pharmacy Dexcom Billing Weirdness- Anyone Else?,"My old insurance provider (Oscar) made me get my Dexcom supplies through a mail-order pharmacy (Better Living Now), and I'd have to pay in full over the phone before they'd send me the sensors and transmitters. But about 3 years ago, I got a bill from them saying that the supplies I'd bought from them– more than a year before– had been charged wrong, and that I now owed them $975 more, due immediately. I called and asked what the problem was, and was told it was a billing issue between Better Living Now and Oscar, so then I called Oscar and they pretty much said the same thing. I said ""kind of sounds like your mistake more than mine, so why am I being charged?"" They didn't have an answer, but they also didn't stop sending me bills, and now I'm getting calls from a collection agency. This is why Oscar is my former insurance provider.

Finding travel abroad summer programs for T1 son,"TL:DR - Are there any good travel abroad programs for type 1 teens? 

My son (16) loves learning about different cultures and has a real passion for travel. He's looking at becoming a foreign correspondent. 

We're not wealthy. For the past few years I've been scraping together enough savings to possibly send him on a  summer abroad trip. I went on two when I was in high school and it has greatly impacted how I see and understand the world. It was possibly the best thing my parents ever did for me. 

I absolutely will not hold him back from his dream of traveling, but I'm trying to look for the best/safest/most supportive options for him to travel and be independent. 

I know he would prefer to go with a group of teens (like I did) and a few chaperones. Top of his list to visit is Norway. Does anyone know/had experience with T1 teens traveling abroad for a few weeks in the summer?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14w1abh/finding_travel_abroad_summer_programs_for_t1_son/,[]
Advice on equipment,"So ive been looking into what all my insurance will cover in terms of cgm's because ive kind of been having problems with the g7. I noticed it covers the g6 omnipod 5. 

Im nervous with getting an insulin pump because when i first tried it 15 years ago, it went horribly and my body constantly treated it like an infection. But with changes in technology and my body not causing problrms with the g7, im wondering if itd be worth switching over?

Overwhelmed but committed,"First off thank you to any help, I apologize for the length. My brother (early 20s) moved in with me 12 months ago & is diabetic. Before being diagnosed as Type 1 he had a few brain surgeries to cut out carnivorous malformations, which also greatly affected his critical thinking/problem solving abilities. Despite both conditions he has been on his own since 16 & has had a rough go. I knew going in his blood sugar management couldn’t be the best.  

Since moving in I’ve found him 5-6x having seizures, we found it’s been due to mismanagement of his blood sugars not his other condition. Finally got him on a G7 Dexcom last week but really struggling with stopping the fluctuations everytime he eats. He’ll swing from 70-350 blood sugar frequently. From reading, it seems having blood go out of the 80-185 range for more than 15 minutes is an issue. I’ve come to discover he & I  know very little on blood sugar management. Currently working on cutting carbs out of his diet, having him take insulin 15-30 min. before he eats, and accurate carb counts. 

Please excuse my ignorance I’m learning everything on the job and it’s a bit overwhelming. 

Anyone have any advice/tips that have helped you or someone you take care of?

Unfortunately I don\'t have the exact ratio of F&P to extra carbs, but it definitely helped me out overall.\n\nAlso, another thing would be physical exercise. Anytime I go to take a walk in the morning, even if it\'s just a .5 mile walk, it heavily affects my afternoon, and very often I\'ll just sit there doing nothing because my number won\'t come up above 110-130.

I know the doctors always say that ""just eat whatever and bolus for it"", that\'s nowhere near as complex as it really is. Eating healthier does make blood sugar management easier.

I was only allowed to test in the nurses office (which only had cold water in the sink - so much fun to get that much blood after washing in an ice bath in winter) and no insulin was allowed on school grounds. When I went into high school and switched to taking more than 2 shots a day, we didn't tell the school anything (they in theory knew I was diabetic but had no instructions for my care) and I carried my meter and insulin in my backpack.

Even with a 504 plan that was a mess, and my mom was a teacher at the same school (she taught 7th grade until he reached 7th grade - then switched to 5th)! Teachers would yell at him for drinking chocolate milk, he was sent to the office for eating candy when making gingerbread houses in class (my mom sent the candy and knew he would eat it - just like all the other kids), and he had a health class where they taught that ALL diabetes was caused by poor life choices despite having an underweight 3rd grader (approximate - it may have been 2nd or 4th grade) who was T1 in class.

When I was in school there was no nurse but they kept my insulin in the counselors office and I would go in and take it before lunch. Luckily where I lived there were a TON of Karens so they didn't really argue with parents but they didn't want needles roaming the school so they kept them and I'd just go get into it.

Just because there might be a few people out there who have issues (there are many reasons why T1’s can end up DKA, from the initial diagnosis obviously, to those who’d walk with depression because of this disease, pump site failure, illness, stress, lack of access to insulin, and many other reasons) is absolutely no excuse for doctors and nurses to joke about DKA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI’m always on subs trying to encourage advocacy and spreading knowledge about T1, but don’t know what to say anymore.

You're in a tough phase now, but you're not going to just go through withdrawal obviously, so once this is all routine bs order extra everything!! Insulin, needles, test kits and strips, etc. It is easy to just do whatever you want without anyone watching at all. Maybe it will take a lot for you to do that, but it'll completely relieve you of any stress in all of this.\n\nI have a bad habit of just barfing more and more hoping DKA will just turn out to be high bs and go away though, I hate medical help of any kind that much and my entire mindset is definitely not one to follow closely for people who worry much and are in more delicate situations. However, I do manage my own type 1 and I am fine. I resent my doctor, my appts with him are basically 10min reruns of nothing at all, I keep up with him just because my family thinks he is the reason I'm alive. I'm thinking of bootlegging my needles to actual junkies these days, I am lucky and get my supplies for free.

BG won't come down.,"Hello, I'm new to the group.

I'm T1D (brittle) from birth, 47 years old.

I have been on Medtronic pumps for about ten years, currently I am on a Minimed 770G, I am also on a Guardian CGM.

Late last night I had a BG spike while taking a nap, was above 300 when I woke up.

Naturally, I bolused a correction and waited, an hour later it had not come down but had shot up to above 350.

Cut to 4 hours and two more boluses later and it was still not coming down.

I decided to give myself a 3 unit injection via syringe and it is finally coming down.

The only conclusion I  can surmise is that my pump wasn't delivering insulin yet gave me no warning along those lines.

Has anyone ever experienced this with Medtronic pumps where they stop delivering yet can't seem to detect it?

No movement or goes up?  Change insulin and inset.  Check if a bent cannula is the reason for bad results.   \n3.  Give a new correction bolus that ignores IOB (insulin on board) factor.  \n4.  Check one hour later for movement.  No movement or goesl up, repeat 3 & 4 a couple of times.  \n5.  After 6-8 hours fighting a stubborn high, I have previously administered a small correction dose into muscle tissue.  This is a last resort, but usually works.  \nAs the other commentor said:  Drink copious amounts of water and monitor ketone levels.  \nGood Luck.', 'I’m also on a 770G pump with a guardian (3) sensor.\n\nHere’s what I do in a situation like that:\n\nPre-step: I recognize my blood sugar is high or way above my target range (more than 120 points past the highest  target reading). I double check with a finger prick and confirm. \n\n1) Give correction dose according to my pump settings. Wait 90 minutes \n\n2) Check blood sugar again via finger prick and see if it moved. \n\n2.1 If it moved down by at least 20 points, I am comfortable in knowing my pump and cannula are working and maybe it’s what i ate / didn’t bolus enough, or random bout of insulin resistance.\n\n2.2 If it moved down by less than 20 points or is relatively the same, move to step 3.\n\n2.3. If blood sugar is higher, move directly to step 4.\n\n3) Give another correction dose with my pump settings, drink at least 6 oz of water and move around a bit (whether marching in place or walking around my house). Go back to steps 2.1-2.3 after 60 minutes this time after testing blood sugar via finger prick again.\n\n4) In the event it’s still same or rising higher, take out the cannula, give a subcutaneous shot of fast acting insulin (amount varies depending on my BS level) and put in a new infusion set in a different location. If the cannula is bent then I assume it’s infusion set failure (unfortunately, minimed pumps sometimes can miss it). If it’s straight and I see some insulin coming out, I assume it was my site had too much scar tissue.\n\nI’ve noticed on fatty/over used site areas on my stomach, my minimed pump wouldn’t alarm that insulin isn’t delivering. Maybe because it technically is going through but the scar tissue/fat isn’t absorbing it. If you been using a pump for a super long time (even if you rotate sites) , it can still make you prone to scaring and fatty deposits building up in certain locations on the body—especially if your genetically predisposed.\n\nI hope everything is better now!

Today I “guessed” myself out of DKA.,"Went to work 1 hour away from where I live. Forgot glucometer at home, also forgot to bolus for breakfast. What a fuckin’ combo, right?!

Well I get to work and a half hour later I feel muscle tension underneath my elbows, above my knee caps, and in my forearms. Including nausea. Something is up at this point. 
I give myself 8 units of fast acting insulin and one hour later I still feel sick. 

I have been type 1 all my life, I know what’s happening here. I now bolus 10 additional units. 
This story is anti-climatic, and I’m fucking glad it stayed that way. 

Over time I eventually felt better, then low, then corrected that low and snacked some, but became low again shortly after. 
Repeat/repeat, now at this point all my active insulin is used up (pump says 0 active insulin on board) and I feel okay.

Standard care in most of the world includes counting your carbs and changing your insulin dose at every meal. This gives you the freedom to eat what you want when you want (within reason - some things are still really hard to properly give insulin for). Many doctors recommend a restrictive diet when first diagnosed (easier to learn on similar meals of modest carbs), but eventually, there is no reason life needs to be that limited.\n\nI agree with everyone here that your endo is not right for you. They need to be willing to answer your questions and should never tell you to go figure things out on your own, at least not without giving you access to education and training to help you do so. I'm not sure where in Europe you will be living, but hopefully, you can qualify for better care and get a good endo there.\n\nAn A1c of 6.1 is great. I hope you are not attaining this by having too many lows. They can be as damaging as highs if you go too low. Target for a T1 is 6.5 most of the time, though you can do better with really tight control. It is typically not worth the increased risk of hypoglycemia for most. My A1c ranges from 5.8-6.3 with T1 for 32+ years.

At restaurants, or with food I’m iffy on carb absorption, I give a micro-pre-bolus, like 1-2u, and then more insulin later when I see indication on cgm that things are moving. Lots of trial & error, not always success, but then I take a note & try to remember for the next time (ie this especially pertains to high protein + fairly significant carb (30-45g+)']"

about to hit my 3 year anniversary,"got diagnosed during 2020 and have a sister that’s been diabetic for 13 yrs & im a terrible diabetic. i’m not really sure i have even fully processed it but trying to take it day by day. i also don’t eat real meals or anything && finding that motivation is so damn hard :/ after being diabetic for 3 years it’s a continuous heartbreak and stressor. id thought that i would have it down by now but no :/ i would love advice for a good meal plan that’s easy for someone who can’t cook LOL but also just wanted to talk! i hate this disease so much and finding comfort is so tough… also a big one big question is that does anyone struggle with dissociation problems ever since they’ve been diagnosed?

Diabetes is a difficult illness - it requires a ton of monitoring, lifestyle adjustments, and even then it’s never perfect. I would strongly recommend therapy if that is financially an option.\n\nAs far as meals, I find that predictable meals are the best. So what types of things do you already eat pretty often? Those are the things I would start with. If you eat turkey sandwiches a lot, then calculate your carbs and see what happens. If you go high, take more insulin next time and vice versa. I happen to eat fairly healthy, lots of fish, fruits, and veggies - but I don’t subscribe to the idea that you have to completely go low carb to manage diabetes. I also enjoy burgers, pizza, and brownies. Over the years, I know roughly how much insulin to take for those things, but it was trial and error.\n\nTry to approach it like a science experiment. If it didn’t work last time, then try something new. And remember this isn’t your fault, diabetes is hard and we’re all doing the best we can. Take it one step at a time, only focus on one thing at a time. And eventually you’ll be a lot closer to “controlled”.

Do magnets affect meters and test strips?,"This could be such a dumb question, but I’m hoping someone on here knows.

Going through a lot,"I’m going through so much man, and I’m alone. I feel so alone, my dad died, I was homeless from ages 16-28- diagnosed at age 13. No friends since I was homeless for so long. No one gives me a chance for work because of my past and my diabetes. I’m so overwhelmed and alone 😔. Sometimes I really don’t see the point in hurting everyday.

I want to get out of this situation but I can’t even get a chance.

I also wanted to acknowledge that to be here now takes resilience, courage and strength. So just hold onto the fact that you have those things in you too. You deserve support, and you are brave for reaching out and putting your struggle out here."", 'Hi Frank, I understand how you are feeling. I have been T1 for 32 years and have a ton of other health issues. I was sent home from the hospital in December 2014 with them telling my parents I was going home to die. Every day was a struggle, just waking up, knowing that pain was the only thing I had to look forward to. I had been disabled for a couple of years by then, so had Medicare and Medicaid, but couldn\'t get the help I needed (CGMs were not covered and I had been trying to get an insulin pump for years). I was ready to give up. I decided that I wanted a future, so I set my sights on going back to school. I spent a year working on improving my health (I couldn\'t even crawl to the bathroom and was living on the second floor of my parents split entry home, with 15 stairs between me and the outside world). Somehow, my determination got me through (and actually getting help from doctors now that the hospital confirmed the things I had been asking for help with for years and was just ignored), and by January 2016, I showed up at the local university to start the process of going back. It was the last day to apply for State financial aid (a grant program that covered all my tuition) for the upcoming fall, and I took that as a sign it was time! I continued to fight and struggle the whole time I was going through school (7 years), as my health continued falling apart, but kept going, overcoming massive hurdles to continue pursuing my goal. I finally graduated in May and am now looking for work in my chosen field. \n\nI know that my struggles have made me a stronger person and that I can accomplish anything I set my mind to. Every day is a new opportunity to move 1 step closer to your goal. In life, we have 2 options... give up or keep moving forward. There will always be days where you just need to pull your covers over your head and give in, but the more steps you can take towards your goal, the easier it becomes to overcome adversity.  It takes a strong will and determination to get through the types of challenges you have gone through in your life and to continue going forward. You have what it takes to reach your goal.\n\nAt my recent graduation, my school gave an award to one outstanding student. I was nominated, but the gentleman that won had overcome 15 years of homelessness to graduate and was planning to work in social services/corrections to help homeless children. Our past experiences make us strong advocates for others like us. My degree is in computer science, and my goal is to work to make better medical technology and help give people better access to medical technology. Without my cgm and insulin pump, I would not have lived to see graduation (hypoglycemic unaware, severe gastroparesis causing uncertainty in when/if food will digest, chronic pain spiking sugars randomly, etc), so this is how I want to give back. \n\nI understand what it\'s like to feel alone. Luckily, I have my family, who have kept me from homelessness, but even when surrounded by others, circumstances can make you feel isolated. No one understands what you are going through, and most won\'t even bother to try. Over the years, I have lost touch with all my friends, and although I interacted with others through school, we had nothing in common. \n\nMy best advice to you is to refine your goals. Decide exactly what you want to do when you finish school, and use that goal to help propel you forward. Take advantage of all financial assistance available to you. Make sure to deal with your disability services office at school (it can be called many things, but every college has one) to put accommodations in place for diabetes and other challenges you face (they can let you reschedule an exam if your blood sugar is horribly high or low, give extra time for homework if you need, allow you to have your cgm out during exams, etc depending on your medical needs). Know that, once you have your degree, all your history can basically be erased. I had an 11 year career gap due to medical issues and going back to school, so nothing before college exists on my resume. Yes, I may have to explain what I did before in an interview (I am 45, not 25), but I can frame it about overcoming challenges and how I\'m stronger for it, rather than just, ""I was sick"".\n\nEach of us walks a unique path in life. It is unfortunate that many of us face so many challenges while others seem to have it easier, but everyone overcomes adversity and must climb their own personal mountains. I am sorry that you are struggling so much right now. Know that your ability to make it this far only proves you can get through this. Let your goals take shape and imagine your future. Let this be the light at the end of your tunnel and the reason why you push through your barriers.', 'Sending nothing but love and support your way- you don’t deserve any of that and I’m so sorry you’ve had to endure so much. Its not fair, especially when you’re also dealing with type 1. It’s easier said than done, especially when I’m not in your shoes, but keep going- you’ve got this. You’ve been through hell and are stronger for it, so you can do this! I don’t know if this helps, but in my own worst moments, I find baby steps help. It allows me to go at my own pace when working towards a goal and not feel too overwhelmed- again, I’ve never been in your position, but maybe in some way it can help, I hope.

Honeymoon phase,Hi guys! I’m pretty new to this as I only got diagnosed with type 1 in May. I’m on very little insulin and I’m still producing quite a lot of insulin on my own. My NHS nurse said I may be in a honeymoon phase and that there’s a high possibility my pancreas can start to deplete at anytime. I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced this and how long their honeymoon phase lasted? Or if there’s a possibility that my pancreas won’t deplete at all?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14u97nu/honeymoon_phase/,"['Honeymoon is very common.\n\nVery hard to know when it will be done.\n\nIf you are diagnosed type 1, unfortunately your immune system will take out the islet cells in your pancreas for sure. 100%.', 'Mine lasted about 2 1/2 years  it happened all at once& then my insulin needs shot up over night.', 'I’ve been honeymooning for 2 1/2 years.

I’m always waiting for the shoe to drop and things to become permanent', 'Honeymoon can last months or years. A lot depends on age at diagnosis (younger people have shorter honeymoons in general) and how quickly you were diagnosed once symptoms started (if diagnosed in DKA honeymoon tends to be shorter due than those diagnosed while their symptoms were minimal). I was diagnosed at 12, only 1 week into having symptoms of excessive thirst and urination, and I had a 1 year cyclical honeymoon (1 month on ""normal"" insulin doses, 1 month off for 12 months). This is rare, but it can occur (I was the subject of a research study in 1991 when it happened). The honeymoon period can be a pain, but it gives you a chance to learn to deal with diabetes while having \'training wheels\'. Your body can help respond to both highs and lows better than it will once the honeymoon ends, but it makes life unpredictable. As a T1, you are guaranteed your honeymoon will end at some point, but there are people whose honeymoons have lasted more than a decade (T1.5 - LADA, slow onset T1). It\'s hard to know where you will fall. If your sugars start climbing and you need to increase your insulin significantly over a few days, the honeymoon is likely over (or you are sick, stressed out, etc).', 'Enjoy the good numbers.

Really annoying me at the moment.,https://i.redd.it/s2y0ky7s8tab1.jpg,"['My main advice is to keep a little food journal. Write down when you eat and when the food hits, as well as when you bolus and when the insulin peaks- if you are peaking and then dropping, it usually means your insulin is hitting the hardest AFTER your body processes the food, so you might want to wait 15/20 mins after you bolus before you eat, see if that helps at all!', 'For me, pasta and oats make me spike, badly.  I just don’t eat them.', ""Oats kill my blood sugar, even when I pre bolus. I stay away from all breakfast cereals including oatmeal.\n\nI'm weirdly okay with pasta!"", 'Carbs take longer to break down, I normally have to extend my bonus for pasta. You didn’t pre meal dose for lunch as well (if I’m reading correctly) so even though you did for dinner the insulin was still working on lunch carbs.\nKeeping a journal will be helpful to figure out your own trends.', 'I TRY to eat meals with less than 30 carbs, but that means 1/2cup of dried oatmeal or cooked pasta. Both are very high in carbs, so volume is extremely important! Since I like pasta more than almost anything, I now buy only non-grain pasta, either black bean or palm heart. Also use non-wheat flour for an occasional pancake after I learned a normal 6-inch one is roughly 70carbs. Still get occasional spikes, however, from unknown sources; only had 1 100% in range day so far, but above 70% 6 of 7 days often.', 'pretty much this. it is worth noting that the the prebolus timing may depend on your make of insulin, the food you eat (protein, fat, fiber, etc), as well as your insulin sensitivity (which can change depending on time of day and activity level). the more protein/fat/fiber, the more delayed the spike will be. and the more active you are, the more sensitive you are to insulin, hence it will act sooner.\n\nif you were to repeat your depicted day exactly as far as food and activity goes, i would suggest prebolusing even earlier, as suggested above', 'My main point is to line up the timing so that the BS spike and insulin peak happen at the same time :)']"

Is diabetes the reason?,"T1 and have been on insulin for a little over a year. For the last 5-6 days, haven't been able to sleep for more than 3-4 hrs.

Can't get my T1D MIL transitional care because she has insulin pump,"So my MIL is 64 and has had T1D since she was 5 and has been in great control using a dexcom and tandem pump for years. She recently fell due to some other health issues not related to her diabetes and she has been hospital for a few weeks. We are trying to get her into a skilled nursing facility for muscle strengthening before she is able to come home (house has a lot of stairs). The problem we are running into is that the facilities near us won't take her because she has an insulin pump. They said they would take her if she disconnected her pump and they did finger pokes and shots for insulin. My MIL is mentally still sound and able to make decisions about her diabetes with no issues, so we are concerned about her diabetes being in worse control if she doesn't have her pump. She really does need physical care due to the fall she had, so right now she is stuck at a hospital (mind you the hospital is totally fine with her using her pump). But obviously we don't want to have her at a hospital when she doesn't really need to be there.

Dexcom sensors never last the full 10 days…what to do?,"
My kiddos Dexcom sensors - G6 or G7 - never last 10 days. See in the pictures above how the readings get very jumpy when the sensors go bad every few days. (The fat white dots you see in some images are glucometer readings if you’re curious). 

Calibration doesn’t always work either. And no, these aren’t compression lows. Every now and then, the sensor goes in his muscle and needs to be replaced. It has also happened that the sensor got ripped out during rough play.

 Dexcom customer support only does 3 free sensor replacements every quarter (viz. 1 per month) AFAIK and insurance won’t cover more than 3 per month. I find myself needing 6 sensors on average per month but paying for it out of pocket is hard every month...

Need honest answer about roller coasting BG,"Hi there. I've been a T1D for over 10 years, never have I had a great steady BG. Always going up and down at all times.

I think he was a bit too high for a bit too long. And I could see that it had bent inside of his body. When I took it off it was a weird white colour in one spot and super flimsy.

I speak with this one woman who lives nearby. Twice now her 7 year old has landed in the hospital in dka because of a bent cannula. And she’s only been on the pump since March or April.

Watching Steel Magnolias made me feel so bad about myself,So I saw Steel Magnolias for the first time recently and I’m so confused. Why was everyone acting like Julia robert’s character had a terminal illness? They never explain what was wrong with her other than the fact that she is diabetic. Diabetics have children all the time. Why would a baby kill me? Clearly she had a other issue (from not managing her blood sugars well?) also there’s a scene where she has low blood sugar and literally goes insane and refuses orange juice. I have never once refused sugar when I was low because I don’t want to die. I just hate how they make it seem like anyone with this illness is fragile and write it off as a death sentence,https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14s4jfl/watching_steel_magnolias_made_me_feel_so_bad/,"['1989 (when the movie came out) or 1987 (when the play was written) was such a completely different era in terms of medicine it\'s hard to describe if you weren\'t there. Engineered human insulin (Humulin) had just come out, a lot of insulin was still ""humanized\' pig insulin. Glucose measurement and control was very inexact. Women were routinely advised not to get pregnant. I received my first kidney transplant around that time and it was \\*brutal\\*\n\nSo yeah, for the time, it\'s sadly accurate. We have come a long way with treatments even though we still have so far to go.', 'There are such things as fragile diabetics.   Control is much more difficult.  \n\nWhile you don’t refuse sugar, I had a friend when I was in my late teens to early 20s that would become extremely combative and angry when he was low. \n\nAlso, that movie is from 1989.  A lot has changed on the diabetes world since then.  One of my parents friends is diabetic and was told not to have kids because diabetes.  She got pregnant and the pregnancy was rough.', 'I was diagnosed in the 80s. This was my first meter.

No pumps (at least where I live) and no CGM. No basal/bolus regimen. Insulin twice a day that you had to feed (you were put on a strict diet that mandated a certain number of carbs at allotted times of the day - too bad if you weren\'t hungry or were ravenous). No sleeping in ever. No sweets (of course we found ways around this). We wrote our test result in a little book that had space for four results per day (a lot of the time we cheated and made up the results).\n\nIt was a very difficult way to live and we had none of the freedom we have today. Even sticking to everything that was asked of us resulted in terrible glucose levels. It was restrictive and we rebelled.\n\nNow I eat what I want, when I want, and get great results. Advances in diabetes technology has made it much easier to live with type 1. It still sucks but people who are diagnosed now have no idea of what it was like.\n\nEDIT: I feel very lucky that meters were available when I was diagnosed and I didn\'t have to rely on urine testing. Maybe someday people will look back and say ""Oh my god, when I was diagnosed I had to be attached to a pump all day and wear a chunk of plastic in my arm to read my glucose levels. You would not believe the constant beeping.""', 'Home blood sugar testing just became available in the 80s ([source](https://www.healthcentral.com/condition/diabetes/continuous-glucose-monitoring)) so it was a very different time.

I could never have kids… \n\nMany people do become combative with extreme lows - or likely she had hypo unawareness. \n\nI don’t find it a super unrealistic take on what T1D COULD look like at the time, but certainly a depressing one & not accurate for 2023.', 'Any historians have outcome stats over time?\n\nOp, it is not long ago type one was a death sentence. At the time of that movie, home blood sugar testing it was barely a thing. Winging it was the way. \n\nIt’s a great snapshot of what life could have been like for some at that time \n\nSure, you can’t paint multiple paintings at once. But don’t criticize one painting and say it should have been like this. It’s just one take.', ""It's based on real people including Shelby she's based on the writers sister who died young from complications with her diabetes. Sometimes stuff does go wrong especially before we had all our modern treatments and technology."", ""This movie is dated in medical terms, we should all count ourselves fortunate to have the technology we have now (if we can afford it) to monitor our illness.  I was a T1 teen when the movie came out though I didn't see the movie until much later in life.  The portrayal is very fair and what happened to her is also very possible, especially back then.  And some people to become combative when low, I have witnessed and dealt with it many times throughout my life.  It is not the fault of the patient.  Monitoring levels was a much bigger ordeal in the 80's, and that method was a vast improvement over the years prior.  T1 wasn't even survivable throughout almost all of human history, it was literally a death sentence.  And this is a bit off topic, but having a baby can actually kill you and it does kill many women, especially those without access to health care, or access to good health care.\n\nMy friend had a dear friend who died in the early 90's from complications of T1.  The deceased didn't see her 21st birthday and was blind, with kidney failure.  Some people have bodies that handle having T1 much better than others and some people, much worse.  If the poor girl was raised now, she would likely been able to live much longer and happier, with the help of modern tech.  I look back at the years before modern tech and wonder how much better my poor body would be if I had a Dexcom when I was a teenager.  I'm just happy to have one now.  \n\nI understand how angry you felt watching that character, I was as well, even those many years ago.  I felt embarrassed when I watched it and decided to never let myself go low (for better and for worse).  The anger should be placed not on the patient, but on the unfairness of a dangerous illness, and the anger should be processed and let go.  It's a hard film to watch for a lot of reasons, but you have an inside view as a T1.  Try to look at the character with compassion and empathy, and let's be thankful for the scientists and doctors who have pursued ways to make our lives more tolerable and longer, with better quality!"", ""I (32f) can't watch that movie anymore. My sister (37f) and I are both T1. She was diagnosed at age 3 while I was diagnosed in 2016.

But for the time it’s set in, it’s pretty accurate — both in terms of TID and the acceptance of women’s autonomy.', 'For what it’s worth, refusing low treatment is absolutely a real thing. I haven’t outright refused to that degree, but I’ve heard lots of others’ stories of doing that. Low blood sugar often causes people to become combative, and if someone is trying to make them eat or drink it can come out as refusing them.', 'FWIW, this was written well before things like insulin pumps and CGM were commonplace. And carb counting wasn’t taught. The prevailing theory at that time was “no sugar” and it was ok to eat it. And dosing for short-acting insulin was a guess based on what your glucose was 2 hours post meal when you first were diagnosed.\n\nAll that said, I’ve been the diabetic who dropped so low so fast that I refused juice. The rational part of my brain simply didn’t work any longer. I was super combative and convinced I was fine and didn’t need any juice. Because I’M FINE and NOT LOW. I actually remember screaming that at various loved ones more than once in my 36 years of dealing with T1D.\n\nSo, while not every diabetic reacts like that, some do. And it’s usually the result of a fast and severe drop, the time when you most need help.\n\nRe: the baby, Julia Robert’s character very obviously had issues controller her A1C, which is not uncommon, even today. So the level of strain on her system could very easily have triggered longer term issues like kidney failure (ultimate cause of death).', 'I made my now husband watch this with me when we first got “serious” about our relationship.

And even if many places in the late 80\'s was well informed, a rural area is also different and as we all know, even today people have no idea really. So combined with writers with possiblity little to no knowledge, It doesn\'t surprise me at all. \n\nThere are still places in the world that have what feels like ancient knowledge and I\'ve visited places where a type 1 diagnosis is a ""death sentence"" yes that sounds dramatic but in many poor countries, village doctors can\'t even measure someone\'s sugars and access to insulin will never be a possibility.', ""It took me a long time to understand this, but Steel Magnolias is truly a product of its time regarding diabetes management.  Our knowledge and treatment options have expanded so much since the 1980s (hell, even in the last 10 years).

Standard practice in the UK at that time was after 2 sections they wouldn’t risk a vaginal birth. All perfectly normal birthweights (heaviest was 7lb 6oz) others were similar numbers. All now fit healthy adults. And no my control was not perfect with any of them. More luck than judgement?

See what your blood sugar does and where you start/end up. You might need to do this for a couple weeks before you have it right. The only goal at first is to make sure you’re good overnight. Then, IF you can, prolong breakfast or skip it to see how the morning goes. Or if you can’t skip breakfast cuz you’re hungry or whatever that’s fine, eat breakfast, dose, and skip lunch and wait until dinner to see how you do. It’s gonna be a lot of testing and maybe some annoyances. Try to limit weird stuff like don’t also try to walk during the practice times if you can help it, or eat crazy huge meals outside of your norm. If you need a break and don’t want to do it everyday that’s fine just do it a few times a week. I’m telling you once you have your basal set everything else will become so much easier and won’t feel so hard. It’s a lot of effort to get it all set up but once you do you’ll have a much more predictable day. Of course there will be off days for illness or menstruating or it’s too hot or your walk was “too long” or you haven’t worked out in a week and that changes things too you know but 90% of the time things will be more predictable. Then you can start paying closer attention to how different meals affect you and what might need two boluses a couple hours apart etc and really fine tune your care to be much easier.

Let me know how else I can help.\n\nEdit: some people no matter what find lantus has a bit of a peak, and take it during the day. I used to take it in the daytime after having lows overnight.

There's so much more to it. Because it's so complex, it's impossible to have perfect control all of the time - imperfect control should just be accepted as inevitable and not as a failure, so long as the right intention was there.\n\nthe second thing you need to know is that, despite the complexity, it IS manageable, especially with the technology available now. Also, the more you research, learn and understand about the disease, all of the different impacts it has on various metabolic processes, how insulins of various kinds work (and how that is different to how insulin from an unimpaired pancreas works), etc. the more manageable it becomes - and it's fasinating to learn.\n\nBest of luck to you, your son and your whole family."", ""I was diagnosed at age 13 in 1965 and I'm 71 now and all is well.

Treatment/management has made tremendous strides since I began this journey and phase 1 and 2 clinical trials are underway now for a cure that evades the immune system.\n\nThe learning curve is steep but your pediatric endocrinology team should be the resource for climbing the learning curve. The tools for managing today e.g., continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and insulin pump are the closest thing to a cure until there is one. I use a Dexcom G6 sensor, Tandem t:slim X2 insulin pump. with iPhone/Apple Watch. A glance at my watch shows the sensor reading and the trend so, if need be, I can make changes. The CGM reading via iPhone can be shared, so you can be the management backup.\n\nDon't fret, he will be fine and will eventually benefit from the cure that is in the not too distant future.

My heart goes out to your son.  The next few months are going to be really difficult, no doubt about it. One thing that I promise you is that it gets way way way easier. Hang in there the best you can.  Early on don’t worry to much about blood sugar being on the higher end, just worry about lows as that is the immediate danger. Invest in a cgm asap, asap, asap , it is life changing and an absolute must to get. As you adjust into this having real time blood sugar data will speed up your knowledge 10x. You will learn really quickly how carbs and insulin effect his blood sugar. The other thing is it will allow him and yourself to get a good nights sleep (which will be really tough right off the bat). Your boy is likely going to go through what is referred to as the honeymoon period, where his pancreas is still sort of working sometimes.

The only things I’d add at this point is (1) Yes, there is a huge learning curve and lifestyle change as you learn about counting carbs, insulin dosing, technology and all the ins and outs of managing TID. But I’d encourage you to be mindful that there’s a huge emotional component to T1D that is sort of the elephant in the room, the thing not really discussed. When I was first diagnosed, I worked with a therapist who specializes in chronic diseases. It was really helpful and I’d still be going to her if she still practiced. You might want to consider therapy for the child and maybe even for you, but even that if you don’t, the emotional aspect — the anger, the embarrassment, the confusion, whatever — is real, and managing that is part of managing the TID. (2) As you advocate for your child, and you’ll definitely have to with TID, be sure to teach, coach and encourage the child to advocate for himself as well. Especially at age 10, he’s crossing a threshold into greater independence. You can’t always be there for him. We teach our kids to respect authority and to follow the rules, but when it comes to managing his TID, one of the greatest gifts you can give him is to support him as his own advocate. One day some teacher or coach will tell him he can’t have his snack or not let him have juice to treat a low or whatever, and he needs to know it’s OK to disobey in those situations and to take care of himself. Good luck!', ""Welcome and sorry you're here. But on the plus side like people have been saying, diabetes care has gotten so much better over the years. I was diagnosed in 1999 at the age of three.

This disease is a lot more complex than “take insulin, eat carbs” and sometimes nothing you do will make sense. And that’s ok, because there are days when you will conquer diabetes, and there will be days when diabetes will throw you around like a tornado. Go to bed, get up, and start afresh the next morning.\n\nhttps://diatribe.org/42-factors-affect-blood-glucose-surprising-update\n\nAlso, learn to look at blood sugar measurements as numbers. It’s not good or bad, just data to indicate how you are doing and what your next steps are going to be.', 'It might be a little too young, (I think the child was 4 at diagnosis) but \n\nLeighann Calentine’s “Kids first, diabetes second” is a good read, I’ve been told.

While I wouldn’t wish this on anyone, I have always felt blessed I got it early because my eating habits were not fully set. I adjusted to a healthier diet easier. I was a Joslin kid. The Joslin Clinic in Boston has always been the world leader in R&D and patient care. \n\nI highly recommend getting a good education. https://www.joslin.org/patient-care/diabetes-education-library\n\nI also recommend he go to a T1D camp. I attended Camp Joslin and it set the tone for my approach to dealing with my condition. Everything is possible - with proper planning. The friends he makes will teach him he is not alone and the education in self care is excellent. Plus it is a lot of fun. Maybe next summer or the next. \n\nLast piece of advice - don’t overthink it. There is no way to totally control blood sugar levels so just aim for a range and know there will be times that things get bonkers for no good reason. \n\nI’ve had a great and adventurous life.

It’ll come in handy, especially because so many questions arise when first diagnosed!\n\nAnd of course! I’d love to give a little insight! I definitely recommend seeing if there is a therapist in your area who specializes in T1D kids. My parents did this for me a few years into my diagnosis and it helped a lot to have a professional who understood type 1 diabetes that I could talk to. It was a little after I started exhibiting signs of depression and anxiety (it doesn’t happen to every type 1, but it is more common in those of us with it). Having so many things going on in such a short amount of time was extremely difficult (not to mention just being a pre-teen/teen), so it was almost essential having a therapist. She even worked at a Diabetes Camp for kids and took me one time- it was an awesome experience. Not to mention, it’s just so helpful to have someone when you’re newly diagnosed and frustrated at times and need someone to talk to! \n\n\nAlso, definitely look into kids’ Diabetes Camp! I never got to go as an actual camper, just the one time I went with my therapist to assist, but I’ve heard such good things about them- he’ll get to meet other kids with it and make friends. Of course, it’s not for every kid, especially if he’s shy he might not want to do it. But it’s worth looking into, and seeing if he’d be interested if there’s one near you! \n\nAlso since he’s young, you might need a babysitter at one point and there’s an excellent resource for finding babysitters for T1D kids! It’s from @typeonetogether on IG- the main reason I know of this is because I’ve met the person who started it and she’s created something amazing for parents and T1D kids! [Here’s](https://www.typeonetogether.com/?referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fl.instagram.com%2F) the website as well! There are so many resources on the site and some really cute plushies that are wearing CGMs and pumps that I think would be so cute for kids! I think it’s an amazing place to start and there’s a community you can join for T1D parents!\n\nAs for devices, if you’re able to get one, I highly recommend the Dexcom. The G7 just came out and would be worth talking with his endo about! If not, the last generation, the G6 (which I have) is also great and works with certain pumps currently (I.e. Tandem T:slim and Omnipod 5). You can get the “Follow” app and connect it to his Dexcom and be alerted when he has highs and/or lows. It’s so worth it, in my opinion. I don’t have a child, but my dad also has type one and we have each other on the app and call if we get an alert that the other person is low to check in. It’s great! \n\nAlso for pumps, if he’s interested and you’re able, it’s a great way to receive his insulin therapy. It can communicate with CGMs (depending on the pump/CGM) and bolus for him. I’ve had a couple kinds- I don’t personally recommend anything from Medtronic (I’ve never had a good experience with anything of theirs and a lot of people tend to have complaints about their devices), but I do recommend the Omnipod 5 or T:Slim. The Omnipod is tube-free which might work better with your son since he is young and most likely very active as a kid. The T:Slim is what I’m currently on (just recently) and it’s amazing, but it has tubing. This is definitely something to bring up to his Endo when/if he is ever interested to get more information! But this is just a little info from someone who’s tried a few things! Insulin pens are also a great option- it all depends on how he wants to control it, and he might not know until he’s a little older (which is what happened with me)! \n\nI hope this info helps and please feel free to message me if you ever need anything or have a question! But I have a feeling you’ll find a great community of T1 parents on Type One Together, as well as on here!', ""I'm glad!!"", ""You're welcome.

Stress or anxiety about school, deadlines, social/peer issues, common cold or injury, will also contribute to elevated blood glucose. Due to these additional factors carb counting is only a guidepost.

When the new school year comes around, definitely make sure he has one with him at all times and that teachers/coaches/school nurses know that he has it. \n\nAlso, be aware that kids (at least when I was one) have a very skewed idea of what type one diabetes is and there are definitely ignorant things said. I’ve had everything you could possibly think of said to me (every T1D I know has), and it’s a horrible side effect of having a disease that the general public is not educated about. Maybe it’s different in schools these days- I hope it is. Just support him and let him know that none of this is his fault. He did absolutely nothing to make it happen, and kids can be cruel. Again, I hope this doesn’t happen, but it’s good to be aware of!', ', they don’t want him on a pump yet because he needs to learn how to be 100% confident on daily injections and fingerstick testing before getting CGM and pump.\n\nIf the CGM and/or pump fails, he needs to be able to use finger stick monitoring and be confident in using injections until he can get a new pump on.\n\nIt’s technology, it can fail.

Type 1 Diabetic Story Character. Need Help for Research Purposes,"Hi guys,

First time here. I sincerely pray the doctors and scientists find a decent cure for both diabetes types. 

I’m not sure what is the proper etiquette but I wanted to learn more about Type 1 diabetes. I am writing a novel where my male protagonist has Type 1 since he was 10. He is 25 now. I wanted to do an accurate portrayal. Everyone in my family has Type 2 and as per my Google research, there are many differences between both of these. I can’t get help from family. 

Google has so much information but I need anecdotal evidence for my story as well.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Question 1: What happens when your sugar drops too much when you’re driving? How bad can it get without needing to go to the hospital? 

Question 2: can you have ice cream?

Question 3: how many insulin injections do you normally take (bolus vs basal)? Is it on the arms or stomach or thigh?

Question 4: anything you’d like me to know to make my character true? Things people might not normally know. Biggest challenge being Type 1.

Thank you once again!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14rqtjp/type_1_diabetic_story_character_need_help_for/,"[""One question I'd like to ask is: Why do you want to include a character with Type 1?"", '1. You get shaky confused and sweaty. Usually the shakiness starts than the sweats and confusion. It can feel like you are falling into a perilous state depending on how fast you are dropping. Can be very intense. Can also be quite mild. There’s a lot of factors. Typically carb load and reason for dropping what determine how severe it is. Lots of insulin no food. Bad bad low. Exercise with food. Decent low but usually much not manageable. Something like that. So if you want him to have a bad low while driving say he miscounted his carbs and have too much insulin. Or soemthing like that. Or overestimasted for the cinnamon buns. \n\n2. Absolutely. No issues. Just need to take the correct bolus for the carbs. \n\n3. When I was on mdis (manual daily injections) legs thighs and arms are all fair game. Even the back fat above your butt is good to use. Injections are generally done with every meal when carbs are eaten. With a 24hr long acting or 2 12 hrs long acting shots. Usually in the morning or supper. The amount varies widely amongst people. I average about 60-70 units per day total. But this can change depending on what I am eating. \nEdit: forgot injections can also be done 2 hours post good for corrections. Average 3-8 injections a day. Depending on skipping meals and such and insulin regime. \n\n4.  This is a loaded question because everyone has it different. I would say being that it is an invisible disease. You wouldn’t know I am chronically ill in any regard by looking at me. A long with the type 2 stigma that exists such as I caused it by eating too much sugar or it is curable through exercise and diet. \n\nHope that helps. If you have any direct questions I would be happy to answer them as well. Had t1 since I was 11 and am now 31. I could be your protagonist haha. Just jokes. Best of luck with the writing.', '1. Lows in general (not driving) I get sweaty, shaky, heart palpitations, hungry, lack focus, and sometimes act drunk if I’m really low. Driving is a hard one because quite frankly a lot of us have cgms and I personally always look at mine or finger stick before I drive. You can get into a ton of trouble legally if a low happens when you drive so I’ve been very diligent about making sure I’m in a safe spot. I also carry a ton of non perishable snacks in my car- glucose tabs, granola bars etc plus usually have some sort of sugar source in my purse like gummies or a small juice box, skittles.\n2. You bet! Just had some tonight actually :)\n3. I’m on a pump now but basal- 1 shot daily, for boluses you need to anytime you eat carbs so I’d say the average person does at least 4 for meals/and a snack and then maybe 1-2 for corrections as needed.\n4. I think it would be cool to show true diabetic thoughts. Have someone say something to the main character like “you have to take shots, I couldn’t do it”. And then have him have some inner monologue like “you’d do it if the choice is that or die” or better yet have him say it to that persons face.  I think it would be cool to have a character that leaves test strips around because almost all diabetics I know try their best to keep up with their test strip trashing but don’t 😂 have him break a vial of insulin and talk about how expensive it is', '1 I keep glucose tabs in my pocketand would pop 1-3, sometimes half a tube or more on the extreme end. I don’t have surprise lows. Nothing burger \n\n2 not on my diet. I’d eat keto ice cream\n\n3 sides of the stomach away from belly button. Before meal. Before bed and when I wake up. Sometimes mid meal if I add more. Sometimes between meals. Depends - how many times do you adjust your weight if on a tight rope. That’s how many  \n\n4 just go with invisible illness vibes.

Cgm sites on 7 day rotation\nc. Insulin prescription on a 30 day? Month? 31 day? 90 day? Refill schedule. \nd. Pump supplies and cgm supplies as durable medical but with a prescription.\ne. Having refills and supplies denied at random times as insurance has a new formulary, or has a form to confirm you still need the insulin.\n3. You need your endocrynologist, your primary care doctor, your certified diabetes educator, but you also train them, a lot.\n4. Walking out the door, right on time, ripping a pump site, cgm off on anything like a seatbelt. Late.\n5. Alarms. Some telling you things you know, like your blood glucose is high and you just corrected, but your cgm pump algorithm isn't sure you remember from 10 minutes ago. Alarms for lows while sleeping, alarms for low battery, for cgm ending, alarms that you didnt finish a bolus, alarms when you don't want them like at a concert, wedding, or meeting.\n\nMost T1s have normal days, to the point that many people they are around don't know much. \n\nT1 is like a second part time job you cannot quit.\n\nMost T1s have stories of people who want to give them insulin when they are low, take away their sugar as they eat, ask them why they are taking so long as the tech does everything, and also get asked how or what did they eat to cause this.\n\nI agree with the others, it will be a challenge to write a main character with T1 without much direct experience of T1."", '1.

Cinnamon isn’t going to help but thanks.', '1. Being low in general makes you more woozi. You start getting tired/lethargic and you can\'t properly streamline your thoughts. Lots of people compare being low to being drunk. Normally just because of experience, you can feel if you\'re high or low, but it becomes really hard to do so when you\'re focused on something. So when you drive, sometimes you don\'t pay attention or from an okay level it spikes down (maybe from workout or stress or something). In my experience, my driving just gets noticeably worse (e.g. crappy turns, bad break control, etc), I\'ve never really gone in a super dangerous low while driving nor had an accident from it. If I\'m low before driving, I drink and eat, wait 20-30mins, then drive if my scanner says I\'m okay. If while driving, depending how bad, I\'ll just continue or hazard somewhere safe to eat/drink. \n\nAs for the low part, I\'ve gotten as low as 17mg/dL  but I still didn\'t go to the hospital. I think the general consensus of most T1D is if your low, just eat or drink and you\'ll be fine in a few mins. You\'ll only ever go to the ER and spend way more money than a simple juice box if you pass out or collapse.\n\n\n2. Yes. It\'s a common misconception that T1D can\'t because of the sugar, but the real answer is, it\'s just a pain to correct. Don\'t get me wrong, I love sweets and as long as I can correct the right amount of insulin, it\'s all fine and dandy. But it gets annoying and expensive to do it all the time. Imagine using up half a meal\'s worth of bolus on a slice of highly frosted cake. \n\n3. I use a pump and it\'s on a regular basal. I would usually just eat the same things everyday, with some exceptions, which makes my basal and bolus per day essentially the same. Aside from eating different food, exercising changes how much insulin I use. The more active you are, the less insulin you need because your muscles/body becomes more efficient in absorbing insulin. \n\nAs for basal, I have 3 different basals at different times. Regular waking hours (8am-12am), it\'ll be 0.4 per hour. Then in the first few hours of sleep, it\'s heavily reduced to 0.2 (12-3am). Then to counter the dawn phenomenon, It spikes up to 0.7 (3am till awake).\n\nThe good thing about basal and bolus is that it\'s very adjustable. I keep a food diary to check my BG at different times and what rises after certain foods. This is a very good reference for what I need to change if I notice a trend in highs or lows after certain foods.\n\n4. I\'d say the mental aspect of it, not being able to live like other people, having to rely on someone else, and not being able to live a normal life. For me, I was a student athlete (performer) back in highschool and am currently still very active in my lifestyle (gym, volleyball, runs, etc). There would be so many times where I would have to stop my training, be late, or even cut mid-performance because my BG was all over the mess. On a regular day, oh well it happens. But when you hit a low and depressed stage every so often, you start thinking ""why can\'t I do things or that"", ""why am I not good enough"". It\'s also one of the reasons I started playing video games cause it\'s very not physically demanding, so I could still do an activity with others, without messing with my BG too much. \n\nWhen I was younger, I had a hard time distinguishing inability vs capability. If I couldn\'t do something because of my diabetes, I would blame myself for not being good enough. I would also feel extremely guilty about the amount of money needed to keep me alive with all the testing kits, insulin, etc. It took a toll on my mental health, and made it so I never felt good enough because I always felt like a burden to someone, whether it be my parents, coach, teammates, and even myself. To some extent it\'s still true in my life now, but definitely has gotten better the longer time passes and has since grown to accept it. Though my sickness does not define me, it is part of who I am. \n\n---\nSorry for the long message, I wanted to be both informative and rant a little. I hope your research and your writing goes well!', ""1) most t1d lows I've heard of involve disorientation and lightheadedness, sweating and a desperate need for glucose, so they usually eat peanut butter, candy like skittle and smarties, glucose tablets, or fruit snacks, or juice. My daughter has an alarm that goes off urgently at 55 so staying below that for too long can lead to those symptoms. It is definitely not a good idea to be behind the wheel of a moving vehicle while experiencing these symptoms, as they can lead to accidents.\n\n2) yes t1d can eat ice cream as long as they dose for it properly. We're always checking our levels to make sure we're in a proper blood sugar range\n\n3) most t1d take a daily basal (long acting) that helps balance their levels over the course of the day. Some take 2 doses of basal. Bolus is usually used at meal times and in cases of high blood sugar levels. Anywhere from 3-7 times a day, depending on how many times you eat or correct\n\n4) if your character ever gets sick in your story, it's important to know that they will need to be more aware of their levels and something called ketones. There are a couple of different ways to check for ketones, some glucometers can actually check them, but it is very important that your character at least be a little more active in their level management if they get sick. It can lead to a hospital stay if their ketones get too high"", '1) My daughter is the t1d in our family and she hasn\'t started driving yet, but in general she gets very whiny and uncooperative when she gets very low. Other times she says she just feel ""off"" and catches the low before her cgm does. On the flip side tho, she was diagnosed when she was dka. This happens (generally) when sugar levels are too high and ketones develop. For her, she was unconscious with labored breathing for about 2 days. It started with her throwing up, we thought was just a stomach virus. 4 hours later she was talking but not feeling well but not throwing up anymore. An hour after 30 mins after that she started talking gibberish. Kind of like sleep talking. 15 mins later she was unconscious. At one point her temp was so low the only way they could even get it to register was rectally. Hers was a little extreme but dka is dangerous and life threatening if untreated and can happen from uncontrolled levels, or dehydration from being sick (among other things).\n\n2) She can have anything and everything she wants, as long as she doses for it (if needed)\n\n\n3) Since a lot of people have already kind of explained the differences between bolus and basal, I\'ll add the younger the kid the less insulin needed. As they grow and age they will need more insulin. It varies a lot between person to person, but the amount a 5 year old and 12 year old would need would be vastly different. Without getting too technical, it\'s based on how many carbs food has, but the amount given per carb varies per person and is worked out with your doctor. And can change. A lot of people have different amounts for day vs night, or when sick, or highly active/working out, women sometimes have different amounts for when they are on their periods, etc. The amount needed for corrections can change too, but at least for us hasn\'t been a huge difference so far. \n\n\nWe\'re still MDI with plans to move to a pump after he honeymoon isn\'t so intense (I skimmed the other comments and didn\'t see this info, sorry if it\'s a repeat and sorry for writing a mini novel, lol) so we still give insulin manually. We, and I think probably most who are MDI, use insulin pens. She has 2 different ones, 1 for the long lasting, which she gets once a day. And 1 for her bolus. She keeps 1 of each on her at all times and the rest in the fridge. To use them, you have to insert a needle cap. It screws on the top of the pen and is a one time use that gets disposed of in a sharps container. There\'s a know on the end that\'s like a dial. You always wanna do a little test squirter first, make sure there\'s no air bubbles. You dial the knob to the number of units you\'re injecting, insert on push down on the top of the dial. And then unscrew the needle and dispose of it. There is still insulin in a vial, used with a syringe, I could guess on how that\'d work based on other medication injections in our family but I\'m not familiar with that specifically. The pens are the size of a marker maybe a little longer. They always remind me of Copic markers, lol. \n\n\n4) my daughter is 15 and I think the biggest thing she\'s struggled with so far is that it\'s literally life or death and for her it was almost death. She\'s worried about how accessible literal life saving medication will be once she\'s an ""adult"" and responsible for her own health insurance. And she\'s worried about how it\'ll affect ""normal"" growing up experiences.... dating, working, driving, eventually drinking and having sex. Also, most, if not all of us have a ""low"" kit. For us that looks like an easy to get to basket with a glucometer (she does have a cgm, but with highs and lows we double check with a finger stick, sometimes the cgms can be wayyy off and fixing a high/low when it\'s not actually that number can be dangerous. In general cgms run 10ish mins behind a finger stick test. Sorry, again I feel like I\'m writing waaayyyy too much! Glucometers test your blood, where as the cgm tests the interstitial fluid. With a sharp rise or a quick fall that 10 mins could be a big deal.) So, we will double check the number. You want some quick acting carbs, we\'ve got juice boxes, skittles and pink Starburst lol, because those are her favorites, but quick and you only need a few. But generally it\'s about 15g of carbs. Wait 15 mins and then you re check with another finger stick. (In this situation the cgm wouldn\'t have updated yet with the sugar that was just given, so looking at cgm it might say she was still low when she actually wasn\'t anymore.) Sometimes you have to repeat once or twice. There\'s also glucose tabs but she doesn\'t like them so we don\'t keep them. There\'s glucagon that is  an injectable, and can be used more then once in the same situation or basquimi which is a one time use inhaleable. This is for emergencies, if she was super low and unconscious. We were advised to call 911 if we ever have to use it. She carries glucagon in her purse also, with her other diabetic supplies and I carry the basquimi (I might be spelling that wrong but it\'s close enough that Google would know what it is and give you the right spelling, lol) in both out purses we also carry a small tube of icing gel (the little ones used for writing on cakes, not the big decorating ones). If she was ever in a situation where she was throwing up or unable to swallow, where choking was a concern, you can rub it right into their gums. \n\nI\'m sorry I wrote so much, lol. I always write too much, but this time especially, all this info is fresh in my brain because we\'ve learned it all this year. And I\'m the type of person who does a ton of research for everything, and it\'s not the kind of stuff that comes up in everyday convo lol. So thanks for letting me empty my brain lol. If you have any other questions, please ask, or feel free to pm if you\'d prefer.\n\n\nOne last thing, I think this is really nice. There\'s not a ton of t1 representation, let alone positive representation in media. (The only one I could think of when she was first diagnosed was baby sitters club and she went back and re read a bunch of the series), so I think it\'s super cool someone wants to get some out there, and is taking the time to do the research, and get the input, to make sure your portrayal is accurate. So, thank you!', ""1: Depends on the severity, but any level of starting to crash (go low) is gonna be a matter of start fixing it. If my cgm tells me its starting but i dont feel it, id pop glucose tablets and be very aware of how i was feeling for longer drives. If im feeling it, im pulling over and calling work or wherever im going to say i might be late. As for going to the hospital, i once hit twelve mg/dl and still didnt go being an american. \n\nEarlier signs for me start as a slight tingling in my finger tips and a bit of an upset stomach. I then start shaking but i often dont notice it unless i look at my hand to check. After a bit my heart feels like its piunding harder but not faster (like, ill set my phone on my chest while laying down and see it move with each heartbeat). And the gross feeling cold sweats where you feel like you are absolutely drenched and sooo fucking cold. \n\nThere can also be some trippy visual effects where near and far become hard to discern, and light is amplified by a thousand. \n\n2: yes. Honestly in theory we can eat what we want as long as we bolus ahead of time (times vary person to person, i usually aim for about 20 minutes). Though processing that much sugar can make me feel sick and gross, even if my blood sugar never actually goes high so i still dont often do it. \n\n3: I personally take usually 6 or 7. I take tresiba (long lasting) twice a day (20 in the morning, 10 at night) and novolog (fast acting) i usually take at least 3 times for three meals, but if im able to, ill break those 3 meals into 5 smaller ones but each would still require a shot, then one or 2 more for corrections if needed. Something not talked about often enough though on this topic is stacking insulin. If you take two separate doses two close together, they can compound and hit harder to induce a crash\n\n4: a couple minor details/experiences you can add in is squirting when doing fingerstick checks. Even with a cgm, i have to occasionally check for calibration or if it malfunctions, but part of that is sometimes when you try to squeeze the sample out, rather than just a drop forming it decides to be a but more projectile. \n\nOn the topic of that: if he's not gonna have a cgm and do regular fingwr stick checks, his lancet will be swapped out at most once a year. \n\nIf he's doing vial and syringe or even pen, if he accidentally injects into a nerve it burns like a bitch. It doesnt happen extremely frequently but it does still happen and it sucks. Other than this, i dont really feel the injections.\n\nWith the injections, another problem i run into is if he forgets or fails to make sure he injects into different sites each time, it can cause a build up of scar tissue (ive got a visible lump on my stomach i cant do injections into anymore because it takes that much longer for insulin to get through the thickwr tissue.) \n\nAnd if hes doing vial/syringe, the fucking bubbles can be such a pain in the ass to get rid of sometimes."", 'It’s not that dramatic.

BUT we can still live ‘normal’ life’s and do pretty much the same as everyone else; go wherever we want; eat whatever we want, drink whatever we want etc etc. we just need to plan ahead some of the time! So I would rather the type 1 played more of a secondary background in the story rather than being the main focus of his character. Because that’s how most of us live! Yes we know we have it but it shouldn’t dictate how we live. So many times when a character has type 1 that’s all they talk about & it’s constantly being mentioned (usually with drama around it too). Lots of us when we are heading low will simply get some sweets or drink some juice & no one around us is even aware we’ve just diced with death. The same when it come to injections; I just wipe my pen out do my injection & carry on. \n\nOne good thing to put in maybe have your character inject in public & have someone make a snide comment about doing it the bathroom. So many diabetics have this stigma that what we’re doing is disgusting or rude & should be hidden away like it’s a secret bit what we’re doing is no different to someone who needs to use their inhaler or even take painkillers.

My life and lifestyle is pretty alternative and it\'s created situations and challenges that might not exist for most. I\'ve been told many times that I make things harder than they need to be but I\'ve never NOT done something because I\'m diabetic.\nI travel alot and have since I was a baby, that didn\'t stop after my diagnosis 29 years ago at the age of 13.

I count carbs with everything I consume and regulate insulin accordingly. \n\n3. I inject my long lasting every 24 h in my thigh and usually require between 3-5 fast acting injection pr day but if it\'s necessary there might be more.\n\n4. My personal challenges are often related to travel. Either during travel or access to good medical professionals or insulin. I\'ve been in some crazy situations like being taken into hours of questioning when I traveled to Morocco in the 90\'s due to drug smuggling suspicion, not being able to access insulin in Nepal because it\'s so expensive people can\'t afford it and it\'s therefore not something most pharmacies have or getting help from doctors without boarder in a South African public hospital that was crawling with cockroaches and not able to treat a type 1 woman who was having a miscarriage. These are off course extreme experiences and I have many more that are not on that level. In my everyday life the most irritating/challenging and neverending issue is the amount of ""alternative"" people who think diabetes can be cured by a herb, poison from a Amazonian frog or reiki. I don\'t dismiss that there can be benefits from things in nature but as someone whom is alive as a result of modern science there are simply a large amount of suggestions that come from extremely uneducated people who call themselves shamans. People in general also assume I\'m interested in their opinions on how I should live, strangers with no basic understanding of type 1 share stories about their type 2 grandmother and that makes them expert. The amount of people more interested in telling me how much they know (often incorrectly) instead of having a conversation where they could be educated always blows my mind.', 'Unfortunately, there is no way for you to learn what you need to know on this subject (short of living with it or close family member living with it).', 'Much of the psychological trauma I endured as a child came from psychotic parents using diabetes as a scapegoat for me being an irresponsible kid (I was diagnosed at 8 years old, and have had an average a1c of around 6.3 since my diagnosis, I’m 22 now). I was constantly gaslit into believing I was a unhealthy brat, while being raised by an alcoholic. I eventually became scared to test my own blood sugar, as my parents would start screaming at me if my blood sugar was over 200 (believe me, I was scared of high blood sugar for my own sake. I would test my blood sugar probably an average of 15 times a day before this point).\n\nBasically what I am saying, is not all people are fit to be parents, and not all ‘good’ parents are equal.

That being said, the lows (and highs) suck. Highs = moody and snippy till corrected. This is due to how he describes feeling like his nerves are on fire (I can’t imagine so I just be patient till it passes and assist if possible). Lows have a variety. He has been silly, non-coherent, sweaty, hot, angry, pissed, lethargic, punched (no energy behind it - he was close to passing out), he has had to ask me my name and who I was, he has insulted me, I have alerted him to lows he hasn’t caught. \n\nThese are some examples off the top of my head. If I were to try to ask him to control his reactions/emotions it would be unrealistic. The reality is I have had to learned to control my reactions and emotions after the hurtful occurrences.

It’s not his fault (usually, he doesn’t let himself go ‘low’ through neglect) and he got dealt a shitty hand in life with T1.

But I think what’s hurtful to partners and what you seem to be hurting over is that she is snappy and doesn’t seem like she appreciates your effort and vulnerability when regulated. You know she has mean lows (honestly it’s nothing like a period because it’s literally your brain being strangled of glucose so cut that out) but you want her to appreciate your effort. You can try telling her this.\n\nI’m guessing it’s either the way you phrased it, like in the comments where you said it’s like her being on her period all the time when she’s low, or that she’s sensitive about the fact that she needs extra help to not have brain death.', 'To put yourself in the position of being low, go exercise, as hard as you can for 5-8 hours without a break, don’t eat for the day prior and then also have a fever.

Your inhibitions are lowered and you aren’t always thinking clearly or rationally. Your body is telling you to eat everything in the kitchen NOW in order to get that BG back up, but if you do, then you skyrocket too high and have to take insulin to correct BG and it can lead to spending hours getting off the BG rollercoaster. Your body is literally in survival mode. So even though it seems like she should be able to ‘control her anger and attitude’, give her some grace. Most of the time, quick-acting sugar takes about 15 minutes to hit. So get her some sugar if she asks for it, wait 15 minutes, and reassess. Out-of-whack BG is hard on the brain and the body. Too high or too low. Give some grace.', 'People here have done a good job of explaining the horrors of lows.

Every year we had 2 days a year that we stayed at school all day and would get assigned into groups of about 5-6 people. The day this happened I had already gone low (a bit above 55) 3 times and it was only 10:30 am. I was still shaking from my other lows and didn’t even notice it when I went REALLY low, until I did and by then it was too late. My sugars were 40 and I was shaking and sweating and everything was spinning and moving around and sounds were getting jumbled in my ears and I wasn’t breathing right and I was just feeling I like I was dying. Once I understood what was happening I was like oh crap I need to go lay down under the ac right now. Mind you we are 5 8th graders in a classroom with 2 9th graders that were supposed to help us with the project. I stop mid explaining the complicated part of our project because I had noticed that I started stuttering and then I started noticing my surroundings and my symptoms got a lot worse in seconds. I just told them I need to lay down and went to lay down on a table under the ac.

You are the only one in the group who knows this and what you are doing is kind of waisting our time.” I told her as politely as I could that I can’t and to just give me a few minutes so she divided to sit down next to me and wave her arms in my face and start screaming “WAKE UP, WAKE UP, GUYS I THINK SHES DEAD, I THINK SHES DEAD” and I sat up and I yelled at her that this isn’t funny and she’s being an bitch and to get the fuck away from me and that I felt like I was dying and this is what she does and that she was the worst friend in the world and she was a terrible person and everyone just looked at me horrified. She still decided to sit next to me and start making sounds and breath heavily in my ear and I snapped at her again and she just replied with I can sit where I want and that’s when the 2 9th graders with us told her to get out and left me in the class with one of my friends that was with us in the project that I told to stay and she just sat next to me, did not make a peep and asked me every once in a while if I was feeling better.

My body literally stops digesting at all if my blood sugar hits 60mg/dl. So, on top of the fact that your executive function starts to shut off as your brain doesn't get enough sugar, you are at an even greater panic about impending death. I get very annoyed at people, even if they are trying to be helpful, and I am likely to snap at them. I also become very obstinate as my brain starts shutting down, determined to do the last activity I was planning to do when I stopped being able to process.

My dexcom alarms are set at 80, and I treat my lows then, hoping to bring them up before I can't digest food. I would also recommend that she talk to her doctor about microdosing glucagon, especially if lows are common. I would be happy to provide more info if she is interested, but this is taking small amounts of glucagon in an injection to raise blood sugar instead of using food. \n\nTry to imagine being drunk and horribly sick at the same time. The world is kind of foggy and you can't really keep yourself from saying that stupid thing that just went through your brain, all while feeling like you just want to curl up and die you feel so bad. This is sort of what it's like when you are really low. Your brain has no filter - you will say anything that pops into it. You also may not remember what you did or said when your blood sugar comes back up. If your blood sugar is low enough, your conscience mind shuts off entirely. You are then basically sleep walking, acting on that last thought you had before your brain shut down. Manners, tact, and politeness are not possible. Frustration and anger are more likely due to elevated hormone levels. The body is desperately trying to stay alive.\n\nYears ago, I was going low while sleeping. It woke me up, and I headed to the kitchen to get a soda. By the time I reached the kitchen, I was no longer in my right mind. My parents found me several minutes later, slamming cupboards, grumbling about coworkers not properly stocking to-go cups. My frustration at my coworkers, while misplaced in this situation, was real-world frustration. My actions were nothing like I would have done at work if supplies were not available, though.

LADA is considered T1.5, but for all practical purposes, it is T1, and once the islet cells have all been killed, it is exactly the same as T1.

For all practical purposes, LADA is T1 (though LADA may also show some signs of T2 not typically present in childhood onset T1, such as insulin resistanceand possible hypertigliceridemia), but currently, this diagnosis requires a patient to not need insulin to manage sugars for 6 months or longer. This requirement is still being debated, and some argue that LADA is T1 while others argue they have separate pathologies and are 2 different diseases (like T1 and T2 are different). Today, about 40% of LADA and T1 diabetes in adults is misdiagnosed as T2, causing increased possibility of complications due to inappropriate treatment.', ""This is type 1 not LADA\nI've been through this with my GP and diabetic team \nAnyone can develop type 1 at any age.

I did not say you didn't have T1, just that most adult diagnoses are LADA. Statistically, adult diagnoses presenting with acute symptoms and needing insulin immediately are low, though 40% of T1/T1.5 diabetes is diagnosed in adults. If you were correctly diagnosed initially, they would have started you on insulin immediately, but your doctor did run the correct tests right away to get a true diagnosis; many adults are not that lucky. Unfortunately, age is one of the primary factors they use in diagnosis, despite a large percentage of T1/T1.5 diabetes occurring in adulthood. I am really surprised that you lasted on T2 meds for 6 weeks, especially as it sounds like your earliest symptoms appeared even sooner. I was only symptomatic for a week before diagnosis, and I was very lucky that my mom recognized the symptoms and asked my doctor to check for diabetes. I didn't go through the horror most patients did in that era (1990), where losing 50 lbs and being deathly ill before diagnosis was still common. I was my pediatrician's first diabetic, so it would have taken him time to put the symptoms together without the push from my mom.\n\nI am glad your doctor was able to get you proper treatment before you got sicker than you were.

How have you coped with debilitating fear?,"I've been a t1d for 28 years. I have diabetic retinopathy which is treated diligently every 12 weeks and is considered stable.

Blisters/Rash from Libre Sensor,"I have been wearing Libre sensors continually (obvs rotating sites) since December. I started using the SkinTac wipes in February to help keep the sensors stuck on.

Self care after passing out?,"Welp, after 30 years of diabetes it finally happened. My blood sugar crashed after dinner as I was nursing my son, my dexcom said LOW. I ate like three granola bars then … my head goes fuzzy and I woke up an hour later covered in sweat. The carbs I ate brought me up to 56, so I topped myself off with more food. Overnight my sugars ran high so I’m pretty sure I have some trace ketones today (not at home so I can’t check) so I’m keeping a close eye on things and drinking tons of water. 

I’ve never passed out before and I never plan to ever again. This cements why I’m changing pumps, Medtronic should not have done me dirty like this. It was scary. But how do I take care of myself today?  I just feel lousy. It’s like a hypo hangover on steroids.

"Tandem and Dexcom, we have to do something about the alerts","TLDR; 3 alerts if my BS hits 200 (pump, tandem app, and Dexcom app). THREE MINUTES LATER 3 more alerts for up-ing my basil rate. This scenario occurs for 2 people in the house! Please address this.

OK, so I have been a T1 since 1984. I've been on a tandem pump and dexcom for about 12 years. My pump and Dexcom, notify me of a high BS at 200mg/dl. At this time, I have to both unlock my phone and navigate to the Dexcom app to snooze the alert. Then I have to pull out my pump, unlock it and tell it I acknowledge the alert. THREE MINUTES after I have to snooze my pump (and mobile), I get ANOTHER notification on my pump (and mobile) that my pump has increased the basil rate since it's high. Which means I have to unlock my phone an open the Dexcom app, and then pull out my pump to snooze both devices (Tandem app doesn't cancel alerts on my pump, why do I have this app if I have to pull out my pump anyways?)

Since I have all my notifications turned off (except emergencies), I am not sure why I am getting beeped at by 2 devices in the first place (pump and mobile: did I mention that BOTH the Dexcom and Tandem app notify me?). But it's super annoying to have to do this each and every time it occurs.

Now, I have a 12 year old who was diagnosed 4 years ago. They also have a Tandem and Dexcom combination, as well as a mobile device. Do you see where I am going with this? The freaking beeping from our pumps and dexcoms are really infuriating. 

My control is good, I am happy with my a1c (6.5), but I still have these spikes every couple of days.

Notification fatigue is real. I can barely contain myself when I hear my pump chirp at me, so I snooze it, only to have it chirp at me the a second time to tell me something that could have been included in the first beep, 3 minutes apart from each other. Then add in I can hear my kids devices from anywhere in the house. 

Why do I have to unlock my phone? I can cancel the alert, but it'll beep at me yet again. 

Why can't I snooze from my home screen?  

Why can't I snooze from my Tandem app? 

Why are the alerts 3 minutes apart telling me mostly the same thing (I mean, yes I can see my BS is getting high and I would expect my pump to bolus more, you don't need to tell me).

Intermittent fasting and diabetes,"I have T1D and while intermittent fasting at 20:4 I only need to take basal of like 5 units. 

My concerns are that this low amount of insulin in my system could cause DKA.

I have hear that you can have stable blood sugars and still get DKA if you go for long periods of time without taking insulin or when taking very little.

The reason I am worried is cause I see a bunch of people in the same boat as my and they are taking like 19 basal so I wonder what the threshold of too little insulin is.

Also, I just kinda jumped into intermittent fasting at 20:4 3 days ago and have been feeling great but all of a sudden today I felt very sick and out of breath. I quickly did insulin, ate and am feeling better now.

Diabetes camp,"Hi, I’m a girl in middle school and a type one diabetic.
I’m going to a diabetic camp this summer and just have some questions that I haven’t seen anyone answer.
If you are interested in answering my questions please feel free to do so, I really do appreciate it.


Do they have access to my Dexcom and Omnipod?
Will they start messing with my basal?
Do they need the passcode to my PDM?
Will they bug me about my blood sugar?
Will they make me give insulin the way they see fit?


I know some of these are pretty extreme but these are just some of my worries that I really need to be reassured about.


If you did leave an answer to some of these questions or even finish this post, thank you and I appreciate you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14qljqd/diabetes_camp/,"['I went to several different diabetes camps as a kid starting when I was 7 and ending when I was 16, both sleep away and day camp. All camps are different, but the idea of the camp is to take the pressure off of you in your management so that you can experience some freedom from the constant worry and stress. Everyone there is on a mission to let you have fun and freedom (not that you usually can’t, but this is a different level!) \n\nThey’ll need to know your treatment plan, e.g. basal rates, correction factors, carb ratios) and will decide insulin you take, but will ask you questions to confirm whether their decisions make sense. You’ll meet with your counselor or a nurse at meal and snack times to plan insulin and carbs, etc. Their goal is to let you eat and play freely. They will not take your pump/PDM/pens/needles and administer insulin for you. They will consult you on what to do and then you will self administer insulin (if that is what you currently do. For younger kids they may administer the insulin). \n\nThey will have eyes on your numbers like a hawk to make sure that you are safe and healthy. They may change your basal rate temporarily as you will likely be very active at camp and they don’t want you running low. My basals/long acting doses ALWAYS changed at camp. Camp is designed to give you autonomy, not take it away. \n\nI will say that I went to camp before CGMs were really a thing, so there were a million finger pricks. I’m not sure if they’ll have you provide a share code, but if they do it’ll be temporary just for camp. \n\nI adored diabetes camp and I don’t regret any single part of going. I would go back as an adult if adult diabetes camp existed! I am so excited for you but I understand your worries completely.', 'It really depends on the camp. At Camp Sweeney for instance, they will make dosage changes based on activity levels. If they didn’t, you would be low the entire time! They will save the dosages you come in with, and change them back after camp. They will need access to your PDM password, which shouldn’t be an issue? I don’t know what you mean by bug you about your blood sugar, but they only treat the number - it’s not treated as a moral issue. Especially since they’re dosing you, so you wouldn’t be the one making insulin decisions anyways.\n\nOther camps are more lenient. Some of them let you do the carb counts and discuss your meal dosages with you, depending on your age and maturity levels. No camps should be acting like your blood sugars are “your fault”. \n\nAt all camps, there will be dosage changes. This is expected. They all have endocrinologists on site overseeing these changes and making decisions. It’s not something to worry about, I’m sure you’ll be in good hands.', 'Speaking on behalf of our 16yo child, T1D for 4 years and he is super excited to now be eligible as a counselor in training (CIT).\n\nCamp has been absolutely awesome for him.

I am sure that they act professional and are not messing with your settings careless. People in those camps do have a lot of experience with t1 and often have diabetes themselves so I think you can expect that they won\'t ""bug"" you about your blood sugar. In the end I think you can learn a lot from them and it can help you to gain better control. They won\'t force you to do anything you are not comfortable with. I hope you have a great experience!', ""It's completely understandable to have questions and worries. The staff at the camp should prioritize your safety and well-being, so I would suggest discussing all your concerns with them beforehand.  \n\nRegarding your Dexcom and Omnipod, they might have specific policies in place to ensure their proper use and maintenance. It's always a good idea to confirm this with the staff to ease any worries you may have. \nAs for your basal, it's unlikely that they will make changes without your consent or the involvement of your healthcare team. It's essential to communicate your requirements and any adjustments that may be needed. \nIt's possible that the camp may ask for the passcode to your PDM just as a precautionary measure, but it's best to confirm this with them directly. Your privacy should be respected, and any personal information should be kept confidential. \nThe camp staff should be well-aware of the importance of monitoring blood sugar levels. While they may remind you to keep track, it's worth discussing how involved they will be in managing your blood sugars, and if they will cooperate with your usual routine. \nRemember, it's important to advocate for yourself and communicate your needs and preferences to the camp staff. If you have any further concerns or questions, feel free to reach out to them or even contact me via DM."", ""Looks like your questions have been answered, but just wanted to say I went to Camp Nejeda before 8th grade and it was just a wonderful experience.

Not a diabetic only retreat. \n\nIt was one of my best memories and my first experience taking care of myself.\n\nBack then it was pretty relaxed.

You'll love it."", ""I want to a camp here in Oregon from 6 years old until I was 18. It was a sleepaway camp about 1 to 2 weeks at a time. I believe the middle school level had two week options. This was way before CGMs and just the beginning of better insulin pumps so I can't say much to that. But when I was there they had an endocrinologist on staff, plus about four nurses that would rotate. A lot of the camp counselors were type 1 diabetics themselves. They definitely took all your history and your current dosages and whatnot and made changes based on food, activity, and anything else that might be affect blood sugars. We literally had a lineup everyday of people going in to a separate cabin to get their blood sugars tested, wait line to talk to the doctor, and they would give insulin dosage. And then we would go into the next room to get our shots! Food was doled out by a point-like system basically, but it was based around carb choices. So like if I wanted an English muffin, that would be two points essentially. Every single person that worked at the camp always carried around a bag with things to help with low blood sugars. We had a camper one year that ended up having a seizure from going too low and it was handled beautifully. This happened of course right as humalog started becoming a standard and everyone was learning just exactly how quick acting it was. \n\nOverall it was a really great time, and the one time of the year that for a week I was with people who had the same issue as me. I could get a real camp experience even with the extra work that goes into maintaining the health of type 1 diabetic children. \n\nI wish you all the best in your camp experience and hopefully you will have a fantastic time as well!"", 'No need to worry.

With that I feel that these people don’t personally know me and therefore couldn’t fully know how to dose my insulin just the way I know works for me. This isn’t an issue with the staff or anything of course, I think this is just a me thing that I cannot for the life of me let someone else that I don’t fully trust take care of my diabetes management.', 'Absolutely! I’m so so excited for you!', 'Yes exactly! OP will get so many new friends and learn different ways other people manage their T1 to build their own management toolbox.', 'That totally makes sense! I’m sure if you tell the counselors that they can work with you and make sure you have the setup you need to feel the best! I’m excited for you! Some of my best memories are from diabetes camp!', 'I definitely understand, I’m dealing with some of that with a new endo I’m seeing. As far as food dosages go, camps usually will not differentiate dosages for different “types” of carbs. If your ratio is 1u:6c for instance, you would get 5 units for 30 carbs regardless of what’s on the plate. If you then go high, they correct later. If you go low, they’ll treat the low ASAP. Some of them may provide a little leniency, it really just depends. The camp I counsel at might allow for small changes depending on the camper. The camp I went to as a kid though would not have allowed for any changes, and I actually wasn’t involved in any dosing decisions (even as a teen). So it will really depend. Just know in any case, the team is on top of changes. If they recognize you’re regularly high after lunch, they will up the insulin. If you’re regularly low at night, they will adjust the nighttime insulin or bedtime snack. While I do understand the frustrations that may come with camps that don’t allow you as much freedoms to make your own choices, I would encourage you to remember that camps are usually short in duration. Your control might not be as exact, and it’s a temporary thing. Guarantee you won’t be experiencing any long term issues from a camp experience. If you go to your camp and dislike the way they handle your insulin regime, you can always try another one or decide to not go in the future. I think it’s awesome you’re trying one out, and I hope it works for you :)']"
Can I just complain for a second about low sugar juice becoming more popular?,"Capri suns used to have 14-16 grams of carbs, I could buy a 30 pack for roughly $6 making it super cost effective compared to the 8 pack of apple juice for $4, and they were easy enough to keep in my bag.

Same thing with my apple juice boxes, it’s becoming harder and harder to find the ones with 15g of sugar.

My type 1 bf wants a tattoo and his mum is very concerned,"Hi all, I was hoping a person with type 1 diabetes with tattoos could give me some advice.

10th Diaversary,Hello fellow type 1 ds (and other diabetics). I’m usually passive on this subreddit. I just read other posts but…today is my 10th diabetic anniversary. I was diagnosed at 7 years old and this is the first year I’ve really paid any mind to the day or wanted to celebrate in some sarcastic capacity. I guess I just wanted to tell people who would get it. I’m the only one in my family and I know very few other diabetics (and we’re not close). Today. I’m not quite sure how I feel. I’m angry and sad and happy and a lot of other emotions I don’t quite know how to articulate. I’m pretty well controlled at this point in my life now but that doesn’t mean it’s always good. I’ve spent a good majority of the first years of my diagnosis feeling bad about EVERYTHING. Sometimes I still do. This diagnosis and living with diabetes for the past 10 years has changed so much of my life; both good and bad. I would love to hear other peoples experiences or emotions or any piece of your life advice at this point if you’d be willing to share.

"Gifting: Test strips, pen needles, Libre sensor, and Omnipod Dash Controller","Hi friends,

I am moving and going through some supplies that I have and no longer need. Mods please delete if opened supplies are not allowed!

One Touch Verio test strips: 3 boxes of 100ct (50 per canister).

Am I better off being on medicaid?,"I'm currently on NY medicaid and everything from omnipods to dexcom sensors to test strips and insulin (as well as my psych meds) are %100 covered with no copay.

I barely got by when I got off with my job at $80k.\n\nI would say keep the Medicaid, as it is hard and time consuming to get approved for it again. If you aren't in the metro area, then get off when you receive an offer that can cover rent, bills, food, and a $200-300 copay amount comfortably. \n\nIf you give up the Medicaid for a 25-30k job, you would be netting a loss, because something of that pay probably does not offer health insurance. That means you'll either have to turn to purchasing separate insurance or paying out of pocket.

If your net on a 30k job is ~20k, your take home is $1.6k/month. If you have to pay for insurance and account for copays, assuming this totals to ~$500, you are left with 1.1k.

How to avoid rash/chemical burns(?) from Dexcom adhesive,"Diagnosed in April, and pretty much immediately started using a Dexcom G6. I’ve always been allergic to adhesive; for example Ive had similar but much less severe reactions to Second Skin after getting tattoos, but this seems significantly worse.

If you have the overpatch sticker (order them for free from Dexcom!) - apply the overpatch sticker FIRST to the sensor, pat down (hold sensor down with your fingers for a couple minutes). Wait the 2 minutes before clipping in the transmitter. After clipping in the transmitter, hold the sensor and sticker down to your skin with your fingers, ensuring adhesion for another ~2 minutes. \n\nThe waiting and holding down the sticker between each step is critical, because you are using multiple topical products to alleviate reaction, which delays adhesion.\n\nFor the damaged (old sensor) sites, have a tube of 0.5-1% hydrocortisone cream on hand, as well as polysporin/neosporin (I like one that contains vitamin E).

Omnipod leaking,"Does anyone else have constant issues with their omnipod dash constantly leaking? I seem to never make it to the 3 day mark within the last month and my blood sugar has been so high because of this. I’m constantly pumping so much insulin but seeing no results and then my omnipod is wet near the site and smells like insulin so I know it’s leaking. I rotate my sites as well all the time because I know if you do it in the same spot over time your skin will reject it. But it’s really frustrating…

Does anyone have any suggestions on where to put the pump on your body where you find it might leak less? I’ve also never called customer support because I just don’t know if they would replace them or not due to them being so expensive to buy where I am from…

I’m just wondering if this is a common occurrence for anyone on the omnipod dash…",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14q6kb5/omnipod_leaking/,"['Are they all from the same box? Sometimes you can get a bad box and omnipod will take them back and replace them. Large boluses I’ve noticed tend to leak more often compared to smaller corrective doses. Are you applying it in areas with a lot of scar tissue or an area that moves around a lot? That can also cause some problems in my experience.', 'I’ve solved this with three things. \n\n1. For me the leaking seems to stem from inflammation at the cannula site, so switching to u-200 insulin allows me to inject a smaller volume of insulin and therefore less preservatives which seems to be what causes the reaction for me.  This is actually tricky because I’m currently using about half the volume of the minimum fill (36-40u by volume, this is really 72-80u of u-200 insulin), so I end up pulling the unused insulin back out of expired pods to reuse it for the next one. This is very much a YMMV thing - some people have a hard time pulling insulin out of pods, but I never have.  The conversion from u-100 to u-200 also wasn’t as simple as just cutting my rates in half - I need slightly more basal (maybe 10% more) and significantly less bolus insulin (about 20% less) compared to u-100. \n\n2. I use tape under my pods - tegaderm or IV3000 seems to help a lot, I’m not entirely sure why but my idea is that it just helps to stabilize the skin around the cannula and prevent tiny movements that may open up a channel along the cannula that insulin can leak out of. \n\n3. I never bolus more than 2u (4u of u-200) at a time. This means the occasional really large meal needs two boluses, if that happens I space them out by 15-20 minutes to try to avoid pooling around the cannula. This amount currently covers 64g of carbs for me so I’m not particularly low carb or restricting the amount of carbs I eat (but I do track calories/macros because I am losing weight and staying within a calorie range with targets for my macros, but this currently allows me up to 156g of carbs a day so it’s really not super restrictive)\n\nMost of my pods successfully make it to 3 days now - the last few that I lost early either got snagged on something and ripped off or I just sweat them off, which in my 20+ years of pump use I know just happens sometimes, even with extra tape and adhesive.', ""Formerly used Dash before O5; neither ever leaked even a little bit! It makes me wonder if positioning matters - I always place across my thighs, cannula down and filler port up just because it hangs up less when pulling on pants. I've had no trouble from support to replace immediately if it fails earlier than 3 full days and they even replaced one removed by hospital staff for an MRI after using 1 day.""]"

I am terrified of insulin pumps,"I had one when I was first diagnosed about 16 years ago and I remember nothing but awful things about it. I remembered catching the tube on something and ripping the site out or the site just hurting. I would rollover in my sleep and be woken up by a terrible stabbing pain or feeling pain in the site when I moved a certain way. They would also cause rashes and become infected. 

Have they gotten better? I want to get one but it terrifies me that I will be dealing with the same issues. The pain and irritation is not something I want to deal with again. I recently got a CGM and have not had issues with the adhesive on it, but have had issues with the adhesive on different covered. I finally found some that work but the pump still freaks me out. 

Has anyone had any issues like this that have gotten better as technology has improved? The whole thing freaks me out but I also want to manage my diabetes better!

Most of those times I had the site in for more days than I should (we all do it) and the edge of the adhesive was peeled up, so it caught on my bed sheets or clothes when I moved. The most traumatic one was getting a thank you hug from a kid whose Christmas I had made the awesomest ever (his words).

I wear a sport belt around my waist that I barely feel. It's the closest thing to a working pancreas that I've had in 30 years! My a1c has improved drastically, and I actually *feel* better. If you decide to give it a try, there are so many people on the T1, tandem (or omnipod, if you go that route) and even the dexcom subs that are so helpful and knowledgeable if you have questions. Good luck!! You'll make the right decision for you=)"", 'Good luck!! I have 2 cats, and they’ve never bothered the tubing.', 'Lol when I got my cat I quickly learned I had to hide my tslim under the covers while I shower 😂 it took me too long to realize why my tubing kept getting all chopped up', 'I wear my pump in my pocket with my extra tubing tucked into my waistband. I wear shorts to bed, and my pump typically behaves well, though occasionally, it will wrap around me in my sleep if it falls out. Wearing your pump in a runners belt also works well to contain the tubing. I have also just thrown my pump under my pillow to corral it while sleeping on occasion. Loose tubing will be a play toy for cats and some dogs (like my parents\' 8 month old puppy), but a little care can limit problems. This also helps with the tubing caught on a door knob issue. I personally don\'t think ripped out tubing is painful, but it sure is a pain!! If you are concerned about tubing, you might want to go with the Omnipod or wait until the Tandem Mobi is approved (expected this year and in current FDA review). The Mobi will have the advantage of the Tandem Control-IQ algorithm, which most consider superior to Omnipod, will be about 1/2 the size of the Tandem t-slim x2, and will be convertible. It can be worn with short, 4"" long tubing, with the pump body attached to your skin with adhesive or worn using a more standard length tubing like the t-slim. This means you can change how you wear it to suit your current needs, and you can have a little more leeway in where you wear your pump site when using it \'tubeless\' as the set and pump body can be a few inches apart. They also have plans to next release a holster that connects the pump to the infusion set, making it truly tubeless (I expect this will take a year or so after pump approval). \n\nAdhesive allergies ate a definite possibility. Many people deal with this issue every day. Solutions like using Flonase before applying the set, using tagederm under the set, or using a hydrocolloid dressing work well for most. There is lots of information about dealing with adhesive allergies if you find this to be a problem. \n\nPumps can be a pain. They are definitely not something I would continue wearing if a cure was possible. I also wouldn\'t live without my pump, a t-slim. My control is so much better, I have the freedom to eat what I want when I want without worry, my pump treats high and low blood sugars (sort of) so that changes in activity or slightly miscounting carbs isn\'t an issue, and it makes the mental burden of diabetes significantly lighter.

I am also, just a very food motivated person and being recently diagnosed has already depressed me into a loop of regret and anxiety when it comes to meals. So, when is a better bolus time for say, a slightly higher GI meal, or a snack. I just read an article explaining GI and how higher GI raises BG faster. Anything else I missed on impact or affects would be most welcome info.

A CGM is really helpful.\n\nI don’t do cheat days.  I eat what I want when I want within reason.  I can still have pizza just not three days a week and three or four slices each time.

Exercise right after eating also helps lessen the spike. I like walking and riding my bike.\n\nI have another approach that is on an exercise heavy day (legs) and in the evening (when I am most sensitive to fast acting). I eat more carb heavy food, because my carb ratio is better.

Subcutaneous shots to treat a low (opposite of insulin shots)?,"
While on MDI, we occasionally have had to give insulin shots (via Kwikpen) to our t1d kiddo for a night correction despite the basal being dialed in. Good thing is we could do it without waking him up.

Anyway - is there an easy, analogous way to inject him if he’s going too low? He can be fussy at times when we need him to eat/drink to treat a low and that’s very stressful for everyone. Yes we have many different options for him but still he has his moods…

So ideally if we could just give him a shot of carbs/glucose/glucagon/something subcutaneously so it doesn’t hurt any more than the quikpen that’d be great during a pinch. Should be possible in theory as dual hormone pumps presumably do this.

We have the glucagon injection which is only intended for emergencies and it’s not subcutaneous.

Any suggestions?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14q2ixb/subcutaneous_shots_to_treat_a_low_opposite_of/,"['I just made a vial with high concentration of sugar water.

And holds him over until morning with no more lows. \n\nI was told I can only do small shots of glucagon if he’s really sick (like vomiting after eating or drinking) or refuses to eat or drink because he’s sick. And then, I have to call the emergency number at my clinic and wait for the nurse to contact me with the exact dose based on weight, sugar levels, last time he’s eaten etc.', 'RN here.  In case it\'s helpful to imagine what you\'re describing:  In a hospital setting, if a patient has really low glucose and isn\'t able to take anything by mouth, we give something called ""D50"" (Dextrose 50%) .   It\'s fairly concentrated (much more than the D10 or D5 we otherwise sometimes give) but you have to give a fairly significant volume of it (compared to insulin) to have it be enough to do the job of raising a low glucose.  We often give one full ""Amp"" of it -- which is 50 mL.  Sometimes we give 2 amps (100 mL).  That\'s the volume equivalent of 50 - 100 completely full 100-unit syringes.  And of course, it can\'t be administered that way.  It has to be IV.  But that\'s the kind of volumes it would take to correct for a low glucose by injection of sugar into the blood -- because that\'s what we actually do.  \n\n\nOf course, this is ignoring the glucagon injection option.

I have been T1 for 32+ years and have severe gastroparesis, making it almost impossible for me to bring my sugars up by eating or drinking anything. I learned about microdosing glucagon 10+ years ago online and have been successfully doing it since. It was started in the juvenile community for dealing with sick or stubborn children, but today, many people do this. \n\nTo microdose glucagon, you need a glucagon kit (the IM injection kit, usually in a red or orange box) and u-100 insulin syringes with a minimum needle length of 6mm (it can be hard to draw glucagon from the vial with this length needle, and anything shorter would not work). You start by mixing the kit, following the instructions. Then, draw the mixed glucagon into an insulin syring and inject (subcutaneously) as usual. The mixed glucagon can be kept in the fridge for 30 days (I have used it successfully for up to 90 days, but it may lose some efficacy). I carry a predrawn syringe with me for emergencies and typically use it at room temperature for 3 days. I have also used that as old as a week out of the fridge, and it brought my sugars up, though again I can't say it is necessarily 100% effective. Personally, I find 5 units of glucagon typically raises my sugar 50-60 points. If I have insulin on board I may still crash, and if your child is in their honeymoon this will probably trigger an insulin response in the body bringing their sugars back down, so following with some carbs can be helpful, but it not usually necessary. I get 18, 5 unit syringes from each glucagon kit (90 units). Subcutaneous glucagon takes about 15 minutes to work (compared to 10 for glucagon administered intramuscularly), so it's similar to the time frame of glucose, juice, or candy.\n\nIt is recommended that you start with a 10 unit dose and adjust as needed, although if your child is just a bit low and you just don't want to wake them, I would start with more like 5 units. Microdosing glucagon avoids the side effects from taking a whole dose of glucagon (if you have never tried this, you feel awful for about 24 hours from the hormone surge and blood sugar rebound). Glucagon is also the bodies natural mechanism to deal with lows, so it's a good option. \n\nTalk to your doctor about microdosing glucagon. Not all of them have heard of it, but I think most have. You may need to explain what you want, but you should be able to get a prescription for this off-label use. Discuss appropriate dosing with them (my info on the starting dose is 10+ years old, and I can only give personal experience as a 40+ year old woman). I will say that microdosing glucagon is a wonderful thing, and they are still working on an insulin pump designed to administer both insulin and glucagon to regulate blood sugars - though this idea has been in the works for quite a while."", 'Good suggestions. I hope they come out with something like that at some point…because dual hormone pumps presumably have this figured out', 'Also, when giving carbs during the evening, even if the kid is cranky and tired, make sure they drink a little water afterwords.

Help with food choices,"I’m very new to T1D. My son was diagnosed in May, just got a cgm last week.

I’m struggling financially right now and trying to find food banks in my area to help us out.

My concern is my 4yo who is the T1D is a VERY picky eater. It’s always been a struggle to get him to eat, but it’s even harder now. I know he’s young and everyone says “he’ll eat when he’s hungry enough” but that’s just not the case with him. He only eats a very select few things and won’t even try anything else.

Recently it would not, for example this morning with my breakfast my sugars went to 12mmol and only dropped to 10mmol, whereas usually it would gradually go down to normal levels.

Am I in the wrong? Parent of T1D,"Our daughter was diagnosed with T1 at 5 years old, she almost 11 now so it’s been close to 6 years she’s lived this life. In the past I have struggled with being hyper vigilant and the stereotypical “helicopter mom” x10 because of her diabetes. I am finally getting to a place where I can be less anxious, allowing her to live her life as a regular child for the most part and not constantly treating her as a “fragile” type 1 diabetic child. If you know what I mean? 

My anxiety and hovering was so severe that it caused my daughter to start showing signs of high anxiety + attacks and being overly cautious of everything in her life. I knew then that I had to get this under control and I worked hard to do that.

I am also the default parent so I am the one handling the more serious situations and device issues, etc. so I have lots more experience with this than my partner. He is still more on the anxious side of dealing with her diabetes. Kind of in helicopter dad mode, similar to how I used to be. It’s not entirely his fault because he is away for work often in his career and his jobs last anywhere from 1 day to 3 weeks. 

Anyways, the issue here is that my partner doesn’t feel comfortable with the fact that I am starting to allow our daughter be more independent with her diabetes care. She will bolus herself for meals without help if she doesn’t ask for it, and I leave it up to her when she changes her devices (omnipod + CGM) because she has lived with them every day for the last 6 years. 

Example, her pod is right now considered“expired” but my daughter is aware that her pod still has 25+ units of insulin and will still work for 4-7hrs so she doesn’t want to change it. I have allowed her to make that choice for a while now and her father absolutely hates it. He says I’m being neglectful and it’s going to result in a crisis that could’ve been avoided. I want to note that since I let her start taking charge of her care, there hasn’t been a single “crisis” or incident that could be blamed on my lack of attention or care, or my daughters.

He doesn’t believe we should trust her because of her age, but I would argue that she is much more aware and understanding of her needs than we are sometimes, when it comes to her diabetes. Our relationship is strong and we are great together, except for this one thing. For him the argument is a big enough issue that it impacts our relationship and it kills me.

I just really want to know if I’m being difficult and should not allow this anymore for his comfort as a T1 parent just like me, or if maybe he should realize that it’s time to let her have more responsibility and control of her diabetic care because she is getting older. 

She will soon be a preteen and want to go do things with her friends that doesn’t involve us and I would hate for her to miss out on those kinds of things because she can’t take of herself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14o10gz/am_i_in_the_wrong_parent_of_t1d/,"['I can’t speak as a parent, but as the child diagnosed at 7yo, you’re absolutely doing the right thing.

As long as she is not abusing the +8 hours (like it expires in the middle of school and she has to come home), then why would anyone care?

Ever since I've become so independent I've lost most support, I've heard from diabuddies that their parents still willingly change their pods when they want/need that help and I wish I had that. Id encourage you to allow your partner to read these comments and see how helpful this independence could be for her!

Good luck to you and your family OP!!"", 'I haven’t seen this suggested, but if it’s possible for your family, I would highly recommend sending her to a type 1 diabetes specific summer camp (especially sleep away!). it’s a great opportunity for her to learn to take care of herself in an environment that’s designed for kids with type 1. Gives her an opportunity to get some independence, as well as build confidence from both you and your husband about her ability to make decisions and take care of herself. \n\nIt’s also really healthy for her to develop independence while she has her support system around her and it’s safe for her to make mistakes.', 'I can only imagine how fucking stressful it is to be a parent of a type a child. That being said, over time, you do develop and ""instict"" with this disease.

It will help her.in the long run', 'I am also the primary parent of a 12 year old T1 who was diagnosed at 8. \n\nI was so far up him bum for a while, but I realized early on I was causing him some anxiety issues. Then I (my husband told me I had to give him space) backed up a bit and let him take the lead slowly. \n\nAnd we did all those things because of those exact reasons that you stated in your last paragraph. I was also worried that if anything happened to me or my husband he wouldn’t be prepared to take care of himself. \n\nHe’s now going to his friends pretty often since it’s summer. He has after school activities and sleep overs. I have access to his Dexcom and he has a phone where he can call me if he needs me. But I know that he is able to take care of himself and it put my mind at ease. \n\nWe also have a rule that if any point in time he is just burnt out and having a day that all he has to do is come to us and say I’m having a day can you please take over and we will. \n\nI know it’s a lot for a kid, but I have also seen adults who’s parents did everything for them as a T1 and then we’re not able to function as an adult no longer in their parents home. Then ending up in the hospital multiple times a year because they just don’t want to do it because they never really had to. \n\nI don’t think you’re wrong and it’s a natural progression of them growing up and learning how to take care of themselves.', 'I too am the parent of a now grown type 1 diabetic. I say you are a wonderful parent and it’s just awful your partner is calling you neglectful. Every child is different but it sounds like you are very balanced and wise on how much your daughter can handle. You are wisely overseeing her but giving her enough reign to approach a normal (and FUN) teen life moving on to an adult independent life. Even a type 1 diabetic deserves to have a happy life. And there may be mistakes made, an illness, or as you said a “crisis”. It happens to all of us. Especially in the learning and growing  process. Right now you are her safety net. But you ultimately have to trust her. So keep doing what you’re doing. Being second guessed and called neglectful by your partner is not right.', 'Oh just wanted to add sometimes hormones (and just the stress of growing up, grades, social pressure) can wreak havoc on numbers especially in teens and very especially on teen girls when they start their time of the month. So don’t blame her if that happens. We were both micromanaging during that time with Dexcom share and charts and it was just a fact of life. It’s not her fault if that happens! They grow out of it and level off in adulthood.', ""My son is 6 and was diagnosed  2 months ago and he already manages some elements of his care.\n\nI don't think you're wrong, but your partner isn't either. I think there's a middle ground here where you both actually get everything you want. \n\nFor you, you want your child to be able to manage their own diabetes, because it's going to be fully up to them at some point. You also don't want to prod too much and have her push back, especially as she becomes a teenager where she neglects her care from 15-22.\n\nYour partner doesn't want anything bad to happen to her, and fears you ceding care increases those odds because she's still just a child.\n\nThe thing is, you can totally have both. You can have your daughter manage her care as much as she's comfortable, like you want but then just oversee it so you know nothing bad will happen to assuage your partner. \n\nThe pump is a good example. It's expired, but has remaining insulin and had 6-7 hours left. You knew both of these things. Something bad will only happen if you're totally unaware and let her pump completely die leading to dka. But you knew you had time and your daughter did too (or you could at least remind her).\n\nThis is kind of like a Dexcom expiring and having a grace period. Maybe changing the pump right then and there would be inconvenient, and changing it before bed made more sense. \n\nEvery child is different, but 11 is plenty reasonable to handle some level of care. Maybe when she boluses have her check with you first just to make him feel better. If she's spot on tell her, and tell your partner it's exactly how you would have bolused. Let them know that she's not just doing it, but doing it well. Let him know you're keeping an eye on her numbers, especially as hormones and puberty hit and may require more hands on care from you, etc."", ""In our scenario, it is exactly the opposite! Our son now is 13, and still we are the ones who change his omni and dexcom, and he does not mind, and he is happy about it. It's not that he doesn't know how to do it. He knows everything, and he can replace his pod or dexcom with no problem. But in our opinion, if we can lessen the burden of doing extra diabetic things for the time being, we do not mind doing that at all. We are willing to do it as much as diabetic related tasks for him if that is giving him freedom of time and less worry and anxiety to handle the replacement of his devices and etc. He knows we will back up when he wants us to stop doing it for him, and he knows all he needs to do to ask us to stop!"", 'You are doing the right thing. I\'ve seen my T1 sister getting her independence early and managing her diabetes herself (sometimes poorly, teens gonna be teens). There were some ""crisis"" of course but this happens to adults as well, and the true measure is how we deal with it. \n\n\nWhat I noted is that you spouse can be away weeks at a time. I can imagine that it can be worrying letting go of the control in this situation. So while he trusts you and your daughter, and even if she gave him no reason to doubt her, knowing he could be hours away if something goes wrong could simply be too much.\n\nIf she has a CGM that allows it and she agrees, you could follow her BG and you would able to react if something goes really bad.

I always do this, as I don’t want to waste the insulin or the pod and sometimes it’s not convenient to do a pod change when the alarm starts going off.  Omnipod user for 6 years.  It’s her Illness to manage, and she will become stronger as a person for managing it on her own.  Do you have her dexcom data on your phone?  I think that’s enough of a guardrail, maybe you could have a weekly check in for her to talk through how the week went and what her decision processes were for various situations.  Not medical advice, just t1d fellow advice, I think your partner needs to learn more about it.  It’s so overwhelming to have a helicopter person who is not diabetic, as diabetics we are forced to think about it every minute, don’t need a second person acting as an alarm as we put up with constant beeping all day.  Also, not a parent, take with grain of salt', 'I think you\'re doing the right thing. At the end of the day your daughter does know her own body and diabetes needs better than anyone, even her doctor and her parents. This disease is somewhat unique that way. As long as your daughter is continuing to be responsible and the decisions she\'s making are reasonable, I think you are right to trust her.\n\nOf course, if she starts skipping insulin doses or something like that, you will have to step back in. A lot of diabetics go through a kind of denial phase, particularly in their teen years, so as she gets older you may have to revisit this system.\n\nI think doing some kind of trust but verify system should work. Like I wouldn\'t leave it all on her. Trust her to manage it, but maybe you always make sure you have a tube of glucose tabs on you in case your daughter forgets one day. Or when you travel far from home let her pack her supplies, but just double check before you leave that she has backup insulin etc. So you are still trusting her to manage her own diabetes, but you are a fall back for her in case she misses something.  Let her know that Mom has her back if she makes a mistake - which she will, she\'s human - and that she has another person in her corner to help her (without judgement) if she needs it. If she has a CGM I would get the alerts sent to your phone as well. Don\'t nag her everytime her blood sugar is slightly high or low, but this way you can just kind of keep an eye out - like if she\'s been high for an extended period of time check in with her If she wants to try a pump change. Or if she goes low and night and you don\'t hear her wake up to eat a snack, go in and check on her.\n\nThis is a really difficult balance you are trying to strike and it sounds like you are doing an admirable job. Diabetes is a 24/7 job, and as a T1 myself, I know my diabetes better than anyone. Every time my mom or someone nags or second guesses me it makes we want to just lose my mind. It is really, really frustrating. But my situation was slightly different -I\'m an adult now, and I was diagnosed at 16. I did my own testing and shots from the beginning. Neither of my parents has ever given me a shot. I doubt they\'d know how to work my pump if they tried. They are wonderful and very supportive, but because they don\'t have the necessary knowledge, whenever they question me it is incredibly frusterating since they are coming at it from a place of relative ignorance. But I can\'t imagine being a parent of an 11 year old with diabetes. I would be very scared and anxious and would want to helicopter as well. All that is to say, I think you\'re doing a good job really thinking about this issue and not approaching it from a defensive posture. Your husband\'s reaction is natural, but it sounds like the three of you just need to sit down and talk. Being too pushy and aggressive with your daughter could cause her to withdraw and hide how her diabetes is going from you, and eventually not come to you if she is having a problem and does need help.\n\nI completely agree with what the other commenters are saying about not reacting with anger is something goes wrong. It\'s okay to be scared and worried, but don\'t lash out. When you\'re diabetic being high or low can feel like a personal, almost moral failing. (especially when you\'re younger). For a long time I was so embarrassed when my A1c was bad. Being asked how your blood sugar is is kind of like being asked what your weight is. It took me may years to move past this way of thinking and not feel so much shame.\n\nYou don\'t want to make your daughter start feeling guilt and shame so she is unwilling to communicate openly with you, since she will still need your help. Even now as an adult sometimes my mom will hear my Dexcom alert and be like, ""well, why is your blood sugar high?"" in an accusatory way. It makes me want to just scream, ""because my pancreas doesn\'t work and sometimes this just happens!! Back off!"" You don\'t want to make your daughter feel that way.', 'You are absolutely doing the right thing. By the age 10 or so, children should be able to manage, for the most part, independently.

By teaching her that she can handle this disease on her own (within reason), you are giving her the confidence that she will need as an adult. When I was diagnosed, my mom, who is also type 1, was sitting with me while I was sobbing, trying to put on my first Dexcom. I asked if she would do it for me, and she said that this is something I had to do on my own, and that I have to know how to do these things. \n\nYou are doing an exceptional job and I think any medical provider would agree that you are setting her up for success.

It’s very thoughtful of you being a supportive and kind parent, you can always check in by asking her how is everything going!', ""I agree with this. I was diagnosed at 12, and my parents let me do everything myself. This was in a time where much less technology existed, and I needed to take blood sugars, count carbs (or before that, exchanges), mentally calculate insulin doses, draw, and inject insulin. Technology makes things easier. Your daughter's Omnipod will calculate the correct dose (and possibly increase and decrease her insulin dose depending on version), and the dexcom can alarm to let you both know when there is an issue. I grew up responsible for managing my disease and was much better off because of it. Contrast that with my brother, who was diagnosed at 3.5 (he is 20 years younger than I am). My parents didn't give him the freedom to control his own disease and make his own mistakes. He just turned 26 and is still not fully independent. He will go to work without changing his reservoir on his pump and run out of insulin, has to be reminded to check his supplies before a trip, and goes days without replacing his Dexcom because it's too much work or he just doesn't want to change it. Overall, he still has pretty good control, but he can not be depended on to take care of himself. My parents were not good at giving up control (even though they tried to get him to take responsibility, they still hovered), partly because he has ADHD (this makes management of diabetes more challenging, but it is possible). You don't want your child to grow up unable to care for themselves.\n\nMy suggestion for you is to brainstorm with your husband all the concerns about what could go wrong when letting your daughter manage her own care. Definitely use Dexcom follow to alert you of problem blood sugars - I would set it slightly higher and lower than your daughter's alarms to give her an opportunity to solve any problems before you get involved. Personally, I carry an insulin pen with some needles in my purse at all times (I replace it on the first of each month). This way, I can't have a pump failure, rip out a set, run out of insulin, or any other issue without a way to recover. As I am handicapped and don't drive, I can't just head to a pharmacy, go home, or manage a crisis without pre-planning. Brain storming ways to deal with problems that *could* happen is much better than not being willing to let your daughter take over because there *might* be a problem. Even you and your husband can make mistakes - I can guarantee your daughter WILL make mistakes - it's all part of being human!! Carrying some sugar (glucose, fruit snacks, candy, whatever works for you) and having a plan of how to get insulin in an emergency can deal with most, if not all diabetes related mishaps. We have ALL taken too much insulin (even double doses or a long-acting dose of rapid-acting insulin), miscounted carbs, forgotten to take insulin, etc. Life is not about preventing mistakes from happening; it's learning how to properly respond when they do. \n\nI completely understand your husband's fears of letting go. This is perfectly normal. Letting go is also essential to raising a healthy, well-adjusted daughter who can take care of herself! Examining the fears you have and coming up with solutions is the best way to keep your daughter safe. Letting an expired pod run for a couple of hours to utilize more of the insulin isn't an issue, unless you need to go somewhere in a rush and don't have time to change it (a pod at the end of its normal life span could have the same issue). If your daughter needs your help to change sites, then respecting your schedule is important, but it doesn't sound like this is the issue.\n\nIt sounds like your daughter is doing great with taking on the responsibilities of her disease. This is an important step, and it's good that you are giving her this opportunity to grow. Perfection isn't possible, for you or for her, so mitigating risks is the best way to ease your and your husband's fears. It also will help your daughter learn to do the same for her future. Having a vial of insulin and a replacement pod at school, her best friend's home, grandma's, etc and both rotating and replacing supplies can be of great help - many diabetics have had issue with a pump failure at work making them leave 'sick', when preparation could easily have prevented problems!"", 'On the flip side, if she didn’t let the pod run the extra 7 hours and a pod malfunctions (it happens, or they get ripped off) it’s possible to run out of pods before the refill.', 'I like the checklist idea, let her prove what she can do and maybe he will chill', ""I don't think the endo needs to weigh in on this"", 'Diabetes camps exist!', 'Second Loop', 'Just make sure she has supplies, backups, and fast sugar with her for when shit does hit the fan', 'yes, agreed.

Help with my sugars! Insulin isn't working as well?,"I'm fairly newly diagnosed, November last year, and I'm a 17 year old male now struggling with my sugar levels.

I used to frequent 100% in range, it wasn't honeymoon as that ended mid march, at least that's what my endo said.

Anyways lately my sugars have just been crazy out of whack, like I take my usual carb bolus and it just doesn't work, I've been going high a lot and for long amounts of time. 

For example my ratio is 1:10 but for dinner I had 40g carbs, took 6 units, went to 15mmol! And took 4 more and it has only gone down to 10mmol.

This is so out of the ordinary, before if I had taken ten I would've gone low so fast, now it doesn't even seem to lower my sugars.

If you find you’re needing more insulin, then lower your carb ratio and test it out for a week or two. It’s also possible it was the carb content - 40 carbs of salad isn’t the same as 40 carbs of pizza. It will take time to figure it out, and it’s very possible you’ll never hit that “100% all the time” that you were right after diagnosis (I know I’m not!).

Dexcom G7 - I Genuinely Like It,"I’ve not seen even one positive post about the G7 since its launch, so I was dubious about trying it. After holding my endo hostage in the office for 30 minutes to unleash a barrage of questions about it, my endo gave me two sensors to try, and I truly liked it, so I changed my prescription. 

I used the G6 for 5 years (after 13 years of finger sticks and a horrible year with Medtronic’s early CGM beast) before trying the G7, and I can earnestly say that I like the G7 more.

Did you vision correction change after being diagnosed?,"I was diagnosed with Type 1 my junior year of high school. A week after my diagnosis, short hospital stay, and treatment bringing my blood sugar to a normal range; I put my contacts in as usual and my vision was blurry.

A week passed and for a few days I didn't wear glasses or contacts and was able to see just fine. Slowly but surely my vision returned to my regular corrected prescription requirement. 

To this day no eye doctor or Endo has been able to explain it adequately. I had needed corrective lenses for years before my diagnosis.

I’m 36 years old now, but when I was 10 years old I was diagnosed with Type 1. I was a kind of chubby, short girl in fifth grade. One day I wasn’t really hungry and didn’t eat. I thought it was pretty strange, but over time I just felt nauseous all the time and felt like I couldn’t eat. (A lot of people say they were overly hungry before being diagnosed. I was the opposite.) I was always exhausted and thirsty. I would wake up in the middle of the night and drink water out of my bathroom faucet. Of course I had to pee ALL the time.

My parents were obviously worried about me and took me to my pediatrician. I actually went a few times during a six month period, and each time he told my parents that I was anorexic. At that age, I didn’t even know what that meant. I went from about 100 pounds to 64 pounds in six months. My arms and legs were like little twigs. I still had a slightly chubby stomach because I’ve always carried my weight there. I DID enjoy that I wasn’t the chubby girl anymore, but I have since had major insecurities about my fluctuating weight. I had a teacher who gave me morning detention one time (before diagnosis) because I had to go pee during class and I couldn’t hold it. My mom went in the next day and raised hell. She told my teacher something was going on and we couldn’t figure it out. 

Then one day, my pediatrician thought it might be a good idea to do a urinalysis. And guess what? I was spilling a ton of glucose in my urine. He then decided to do a blood test and immediately sent me to the hospital. My blood sugar was 496 that night, then 46 the next morning. I got to go home that next day, but felt really bad about the six year-old in the next room who was there for like two months. But my parents did buy me a Tamagotchi while in the hospital, so that was kind of cool. Oh, did I mention this was one week before Halloween? 😅

I’ve had a lot of ups and downs since then… a lot of stupid choices and not caring about myself. I’ve gone through many self-destructive phases where I ended up in the hospital multiple times. The other day my mom told me that around the time I started getting sick, I changed from a slightly shy but bubbly happy kid into a sad shell of my former self. That really bummed me out honestly. I have been diagnosed with bipolar type 2 disorder and anxiety as an adult, and I wonder if there is some sort of connection?

Anyways… At this point, I’m just rambling. But it still infuriates me that a children’s doctor who deals with diabetes and knows what it is brushed off my symptoms for SIX MONTHS. That time period was hell for me. My dad was so worried about me, and he would basically force feed me at the dinner table if I wasn’t eating. He made me drink Boost all the time. He was SO stressed and upset and I felt guilty that I was the cause of it. I just gave away my food at school because I just couldn’t stomach it. Six months. I’m still completely baffled by this. 

Anyone else have a shitty road to their diagnosis?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14nibw5/still_mad_about_my_diagnosis_26_years_later/,"['I’m sorry you had to go through that.  It makes me incredibly mad whenever I read a story in the new about a kid who nearly died because it took so long to diagnose them.  Like, meters are available everywhere and strips aren’t that expensive.  Why doesn’t every doctor’s office have one?  They should do a finger stick test on everyone no matter hat the reason for their visit is.  They take your temperature, weigh you, blood pressure.  A finger poke should also be standard.  \n\nIt’s not like Type 1 is some rare, little known condition.  Everyone knows the classic symptoms.  Why do doctors immediately think of a “bug” when a parent says their kid is drinking and peeing and puking and lethargic all the time?  Use a fucking meter on the kid!\n\nI did not have a traumatic diagnosis and I was 19, but it pisses me off when doctors don’t think of such an obvious diagnosis/test for such classic symptoms.  I was diagnosed with asthma when I was 2.  My mother said she took me to the pediatrician who told her I “just wanted attention”.  She found a new pediatrician.', 'Diagnosis stories are terrifying, so often there are missed signs. \n\nI was 17 at diagnosis, in the custody of the state of Arizona. I remember being seen by a doctor for a physical of some sort and they said to me “there’s so much sugar in your urine”, I said “I drink a lot of mountain dew 🤷🏻\u200d♀️”. A few months later and I’m down to 78lbs, living in a youth shelter, starving, dying of thirst. I would do the same thing with the bathroom faucet because the shelter staff were scared I was going to give myself water poisoning. I could only get water when I was in the bathroom! \n\nAfter taco night, I laid down on the couch in the front room of the shelter and woke up in the ER. Blood sugar was 1180, A1c was 22. The glucose-filled urine was 4 months prior. I’m so grateful to still be alive. I didn’t have family looking out for me, parents taking me to the doctor, asking what was wrong. I was shuffled from youth shelter to group home and back and no one really knew me well enough to know something was wrong. They knew I had a history of trauma and assumed I was dealing with anorexia as well. \n\nI’m now an emergency room social worker and I take such peace and comfort in knowing how much more educated physicians and hospitals etc are now, and blood glucose is checked so quickly even when diabetes isn’t a suspicion just to be sure. \n\nProud of us, friend! We are still here! 🖤', 'for me no one noticed my symptoms until i was practically comatose. I was 13 at diagnoses and i was easily drinking 3 liters of water a day for 3 months. then because my sugars were so high i stopped drinking purified water because it tasted sweet and i was only drinking tap water. getting up to drink water was the only thing that could get me out of bed or off the couch i was in that incredibly lethargic state for about 2 weeks until my mom decided that something was seriously wrong with me. she decided that i had to go to the er. when we got there my bg was 817mg/dl and the er doctor told me that if we hadn’t come in i would have had 2 hours to live which was incredibly scary for a 13 year old in severe dka. before passing out in the hospital bed i remember saying to my mom “am i dying mom?”', ""It's terrible that the first place they went was eating disorder, likely because you were a girl. That's just awful, and your dad was force feeding you and making you drink Boost. I'm so sorry.  \n\nI have to always check myself because my own mother was kind of Munchausen-by-proxy-ish and had me at doctors and in the hospital a lot doing tests and stuff. What was wrong with me was likely her. So I worry that I may be overreacting with my own kid and have to force myself to hold my ground about worries for them."", ""Yes very shitty.\nAge 52, came back from overseas trip in July absolutely buzzing from a fantastic time.\nStarted getting a rash, urticaria creeping all over my body.

I do remember going on holiday in the summer & feeling really ill while I was there; turns out I had rubella. I seemed to get better but never got back to 100% health. I know I was taken to the doctors loads of times but was told she still recovering from rubella give her a tonic, it’s a tummy upset, gastric flu, a random virus. I’ve only got 2 vivid memories; one of being in the bathroom drinking out the bathroom tap whilst peeing into to toilet at the same time. I literally couldn’t get enough water down my throat & even though I had water in my mouth my mouth feeling really dry. The other is being in my Mum & Dads bed hearing my Mum crying & a strange man in a uniform saying the word insulin & diabetic. I’d fallen into a coma & parents had called an ambulance; the paramedic knew the minute he walked in the bedroom cos he could smell the ketones. I was in hospital (over Christmas) for about 2 months & in intensive care for 2 weeks. My parents were told to say their goodbyes as everyone was sure I wouldn’t survive. I’m still here kicking diabetes into touch (and with no complications!) proving everyone wrong. Diabetes has never stopped me doing anything I want - in fact the more I’m told I can’t do something the more I try to hardest to do it! \n\nWe are amazingly lucky with todays modern tech & advances being made; the survival rate long term for those with type 1 is very good provided we control it & the new tech makes that so much easier. \n\nI’m often asked if you could choose not to be a diabetic anymore would you? I always answer no! I don’t remember not being a diabetic & I’ve achieved a lot of things in my life because of diabetes that I possibly wouldn’t have attempted because no one would have said “oh diabetics can’t do that”\n\nIs it a pain in the arse? God yes! Does it piss me off at times? Of course it does. But me being angry or sad about it doesn’t make it go away; it just ruins the time we have left & God knows there’s precious little of that for anyone! We’re all in the same queue heading towards the grave; you can either stand quietly in the queue waiting for your turn or join the party at the side & dance your way there.', 'We share the same sorry my friend, eerily almost word for word. There’s not a day that goes by that I’m not still bitter about being diabetic but after many scares, MANY bad doctors, bad advice and rounds of complete self destruction I’ve recently found a better mindset and am more willing to use my tools and resources to cope properly and learn how to speak up for myself. Sending you some love ♥️', 'I’m sorry to hear that. Our diagnosis stories are actually similar. Before diagnosis, I was slightly heavy. I wasn’t overweight but medical standards but had a little tummy and as everyone knows as a 10 year old girl people start focusing on your weight. I remember the summer right before I was diagnosed people at a cabin we used to be at started commenting that I was thinning out and that puberty was going to be a blessing for me. Jeeze. Over the fall I slowly started to get symptoms. I had just started 6th grade and my mom started taking me to my pediatrician. I felt okay until late October when I got strep. I think strep is the thing that broke the camels back and really spurred my type 1 into motion. Over the next two months my mom took me to the same doc I had since I was born. He reiterated to my mom over and over again that I had social issues- I was acting out because I was starting a new school. Meanwhile my math teacher had a conference with my parents because he noticed I was losing weight rapidly and thought I was anorexic. Like you- didn’t know what that meant. My parents actually pulled me aside to ask if I was eating or if I was eating and puking because I was eating all the time. Thanksgiving happens and I’m still not too. Two weeks later I’m in full blown dka and I remember waking up and telling my mom I’m not going to school or I’m going to vomit. We fought because at this point she’s trying to believe me but doctors that she worked with (she used to be a medical assistant) told her I was fine. What ultimately led to my diagnosis is the day I stayed home, I took a bath. I was so weak and had been vomiting all day. My mom helped me to the tub and since I was 11 it was the first time she had seen me with clothes off. I was so thin you could see every bone. We rushed to a new doc, he smelt my breath and ordered all the tests you can think of. After like ten minutes he walks in and im like half awake on the bed and he goes I don’t want to tell you this but your daughter is a type 1 diabetic and she has to go to the hospital now as she’s in dka. He literally saved my life. To this day, I still don’t fully trust doctors but am such a strong advocate for myself.', 'I was diagnosed at age 2 I’m now 29 my parents said I lost a ton of weight (I was also chubby) always thirsty never got up to use the restroom (always on myself) never ate and doctors told them it was a virus I had so it went on until I went into dka and slipped into a coma no doctor could figure it out until a wonderful doctor overheard other doctors talking about me to my parents and suggested they run tests for diabetes and it was in fact that', ""I'm still so fucking pissed off about it 🤣"", 'I have a similar story. I was diagnosed at 16. At the time I had mono and was losing weight and going blind. I was thirsty all the time and pissing constantly. I went to my doctor multiple times and he would say it was mono side effects. Classic diabetes symptoms just written off. He would then advise my parents behind my back that I had an eating disorder. After a month of this one morning I could barely get out of bed. I went to the ER and a nurse without half the training as my doctor diagnosed me. My blood sugar was over 700. \n   Fuck doctors, they have a god complex. Now that I’m diagnosed they are still no help. Most are deaf and blind to ANY issues you have. In the US they are part of the for-profit medicine “game” and just as guilty as insurance companies who put profits before people. \n\nI’m looking at you, Joslin Diabetes Clinic… greedy worthless fucks.', 'Not as bad as yours but yes.', 'I was 32, pregnant for the first time with twins, married for almost a year. I have always fluctuated with weight. I\'ve been skinny and fat. When we went for our 9 week scan, baby A didn\'t have a heartbeat. Tough to hear, but was told that can happen with twins and many women lose a twin before their first scan and never knew they were even carrying twins. Asked about baby B and if they were OK. Doc said yes and everything should go well from here. At about 12 to 14 weeks, I was dropping a little weight. Not great when pregnant, but it was just a few pounds. Again, doc wasn\'t worried. I noticed I was thirsty more and peeing more, but of course Google said it happens in first trimester. Now at about 16 to 17 weeks, I really started to get thirsty. At about 18 1/2 weeks, I told my mom how I couldn\'t really quench my thirst and Popsicles seemed the only thing that could actually quench the thirst. She said, I think that happens with diabetes. I told her my glucose test was at 20 weeks. We both thought to wait till then. BIG MISTAKE. At 19 weeks and 1 day, I went pee. When I wiped, I noticed this odd mucus thing. Went to bed and at 6 am, I felt a gush. Went to the bathroom and knew something wasn\'t right. The water was clear and didn\'t smell like pee. Soon after contractions started. My husband took us to the hospital. Sure enough, I was in labor and there was no saving our son. I was told ""this is just bad luck"" and 1 in 4 women will miscarry. I said I was really thirsty before this happened, could that be why? Told nope, bad luck. Gave birth to Hunter shortly after. That was by far the most horrific moment of my life. Knowing that my son was gone and it was my bad luck. Went for my post partem check up and again asked what could have caused this. Again, was told it happens and we can try again. Had endo appointment for my thyroid. They decided since I just miscarried to do a full metabolic panel\n\nThere in the papers was the cause...Antibodies through the God damn roof, blood sugar 485 and A1C was 13. My doc basically said, when I got pregnant, my immune system went complete batshit and instead of attacking the babies, it went to my pancreas and inihalated it. Type 1 caused my thirst, weight loss and possibly miscarriage. So on top of losing my son, I also got a life long uncurable disease...not what I was expecting at all. Devastated on top of guilt that there were signs and I missed them all. I switched gynos after that. Had a healthy baby boy later that year. Pre term birth happened again, but my new gyno knew that this pregnancy was perfect and my A1C was 5.9 the whole time.\n\nBy the time my next son was born, she knew in her gut that I may not make enough progesterone. So at 18 weeks til labor I got a weekly shot to try to keep my baby cooking. Thankfully, my third pregnancy and third son was born just a few days shy of induction date of 37 weeks. Both are healthy and currently diabetes free at 8 and 5 years old.\n\nI\'m still pissed I\'m a T1D, pissed I knew NOTHING and pissed that this damn disease is my door prize for my ignorance. But even with all that, it doesn\'t control me like it once did. Having a pump really helps to put it more at the back of my mind then the forefront. This disease is tough and I wouldn\'t wish it on anyone. But I have it and it\'s not going anywhere. I gotta roll with it and suck up the fact that we will always be shelling out a crapton of money to have insurance and to keep me alive. \n\nI just feel really lucky to have been able to have 2 great little boys who drive me bonkers and fill my entire world. I will always desperatley love and miss my Hunter. I wish we had more time with him, but through the loss of him, I understand how to be your own advocate. I will NEVER make that mistake again. I will fight to be heard and if the answers I\'m getting don\'t make sense, I will seek out more somewhere else. Especially with T1D. I know me and I know T1D effects every person differently. Be your own advocate and fight for yourself.', 'Really sorry to hear that. Mine was similar to this- 5th grade over 25 years ago, drs didn’t catch it, teachers didn’t seem to care etc. Remember a nurse telling me I may not live as long as the people around me lol But, here we are! \nI feel ya, though. I sometimes think I would be a way more successful and happy person if I didn’t get it. And then I realize I wouldn’t be the person I am today without all of the crazy throughout the years. And I’m not all bad lol I just try to take it one day at a time and soak in the good with the bad :).', 'I\'m so so sorry you had to go through that. That is awful that your doctor never once listened to your parents. That doctors negligence genuinely could have killed you and im honestly surprised you survived 6 months before being diagnosed. You\'re so strong for making it through that and everything else you\'ve gone through since then. \nI was diagnosed with celiac disease just before my 5th birthday. My mom is a nurse who works in a school and worked with a lot of kids with T1D and celiac so she was secretly watching me really closely after my celiac diagnosis. Sure enough, 6 months later I was drinking a lot and peeing a lot, the big sign was I would have ""pee nightmares"" where I would wake up SCREAMING and completely unable to say what was wrong til they figured out I needed to pee, my dad got peed on a couple times... oops, sorry dad. I was taken to my pediatrician and I was 419 and they told my parents to go home and pack a bag then rush me to the hospital as they would be ready for us, we were told to prepare for a week or so there. My diagnoses were weird, most people are diagnosed with T1D then celiac but I was the opposite. My mom said my big signs were that I hadn\'t grown or gained any weight at all in over a year because of both diagnoses. We spent a weekend in the hospital, not super long because my mom was already trained on shots and everything, I was sent home on Halloween day, my parents definitely had to say no to trick or treating that year. It\'s been almost 12 years now and im still here and still fighting. It has never once been easy and I\'m sure everyone can agree it\'ll never get easier, but we all learn how to navigate our new life. So for anyone newly diagnosed reading this just know it\'s not the end of the road. You will learn how to manage it and not allow it to rule your life. Does that mean it\'ll be easy? Hell no, it never fails to be a pain in the ass. It\'s okay to have hard days, it\'s okay to cry and just want to give up, maybe even bad weeks too. Diabetes gets thrown on the back burner sometimes and that\'s okay. I\'m currently bouncing back from having a couple weeks of awful numbers, I was at 37% in range for a couple days. It\'ll all be okay, you will learn how to adjust to your new life and everyone around you who is worth while will be there to help you learn that new life as well. Good luck on your new adventure! And good job to you OP, keep fighting!', 'That\'s no fun. I can\'t imagine the addition of being so young and not really being able to fully understand post diagnosis the implications of not being able to have birthday cake or ice cream at a party (without a special insulin adventure to make me look different). \n\nI was 33 and in the middle of an international adoption. In that process a complete physical is required. That included an A1c and it was 5.3. Meant nothing to me other than the word ""normal"" next to it.  For years I tried on/off to lose the 15 pounds I\'d gained since college.\n\nMy brother in law was getting married and I declared ""no dieting at the wedding events"". When I got home I had lost 4 pounds. Suck it diet, see what happens when I ignore you?\n\nThen I continued to lose weight.  It was weird but otherwise young and healthy/fit. And we didn\'t want to upset the adoption process. So my wife would try to fatten me up with pie. She would always have one around and it (was) one of my favorite things per diagnosis. And had been off the menu for a long time bc of the diet. \n\nWeight loss piled on and so did the thirst and peeing and feeling generally wiped out. Water tasted delicious. Skin started to get randomly itchy in places. \n\nBy about 90 days after that A1c, I had lost 45 pounds. I  was 140 pounds and clothes were hanging off me. It happened very quickly and people at work started asking if I was ok. So back to Dr. I don\'t have a record of the A1c but he diagnosed me as T2 and put me on glimepride with and referred me to the Portland Diabetes and Endocrinology Center (shout out to a the home or the best doctor I have ever had of a total of 8).  Soonest they could see a new patient was a few more weeks. \n\nBut at least I could moderate what I ate (I didn\'t know enough to effectively manage with my still in honeymoon phase pancreas. I could have managed knowing what I know now after having lived a few years with it in honeymoon.   I have told a lot of people how grateful I am for not having had this burden until after college.  I would have struggled for sure with maintaining anything like a normal blood sugar level in those years based on my earliest competency and knowing what my peer group lifestyle was. \n\nI\'m now 180, ~10 pounds over my college weight.  With a closed loop insulin pump and a lot of work stress I had reached 208 before getting serious about paying close attention to which foods were contribution do digestion or blood sugar spikes. CGM technology, (dexcom, etc) have made this possible. There\'s only so many finger pricks you can give yourself and the strips aren\'t free. \n\nI am also fortunate to have never been in the ER due to diabetes. After about 2 years from diagnosis, I went onto a minimed pump. Great experience and solid technology. They were acquired by Medtronic who continued to innovate and had one of the first closed loop systems. I eventually grew to despise it.  It would alarm constantly, otter right after I callibrated telling it my finger stick was considerably higher than it was. I told it. And then two minutes later when I\'d just started to think about something else than the headache of being diabetic, the pump helpfully would inform that blood sugar was too high. Can\'t ignore the pump, gotta bust it out and silence the alarm. Tubing would catch on doorknobs.  They were always prompt with replacement matters and not unreasonable ever.  But the quality seemed to slide, or my tolerance for the annoyances of it exceeded the benefit I felt I was getting.\n\nI switched to omnipod dash, now onmipod5 and dexcom6 using Fiasp fast acting insulin.  Game changing.  \n\n I manage to a A1c that ranges between 5.8-6.8. I eat a low carb diet. I walk the dog 4-8 miles per day.  I drink no alcohol. I am in range 70-85 percent of the time but pust lunch is hard for me. Haven\'t cracked that code without suffering an evening low - if anyone read this far and has ideas, I\'m listening. My diet is primarily, protein, vegetables, water coffee (with cream) nuts and cheese and berries.  Very rarely stone fruits.  I will eat ice cream in evening occasionally. This doesn\'t cause a spike for me with a correct bolus. Carbs from carbohydrate outside of the above is less than 30 per day excepting glucose to treat a low.', 'I was 30. I had just had my fifth child and I has gestational diabetes with her. They told me that it was likely I’d develop type 2 in later life so watch myself. I kept getting yeast infections and experienced a level of exhaustion I couldn’t comprehend, but chalked it up to 5 kids including a newborn. My vision was often blurry and I would sleep frequently during the day. My doctor kept checking my urine, but after 6 months of symptoms he finally ordered a blood test. Then a diagnosis of type 2. 5 months after that, another blood test and a diagnosis amendment to type 1. I was never hospitalized or taught how to deal with type 1, I had taken several classes on type 2. It’s been a shit show since and has left me pretty bitter about this disease and the way I’ve been treated over it. I lost jobs because of it, I’ve lost so much. I’m glad now there’s pumps and cgms, to be diagnosed now is much kinder, you get a lot of options for better control. I started on pork insulin, and had really no idea how to carb count, so when I look back I cringe at how badly I mangled controlling things, and the doctors I looked towards for help let me just hanging and got mad when my A1C was over 8…if you have a good support system, cherish it. If you don’t, please try to get a good team going, I was so lost and fell through so many cracks, it’s amazing I’m alive to type this tbh…', "">he other day my mom told me that around the time I started getting sick, I changed from a slightly shy but bubbly happy kid into a sad shell of my former self.\n\nThis hit me like a brick, my mom said this too. I was 9 when diagnosed and turning 30 this year. And yeah, people with diabetes have hormone irregulation, this causes emotion regulation issues, which is often misdiagnosed as bipolar or if you also have ADHD, borderline. You probably don't have this, you just show symptoms of it since these are the same symptons diabetes causes but aren't used as a rule out for the others. I have ADHD too and was misdiagnosed with borderline, I don't have the key symptoms but I had enough of the overall symptoms to still get the diagnosis, the therapy worked and I got a job where they can't fire me over emotional outburst out of it but every other psychologist I spoke to told me they don't believe I really have the disorder, but since I got some positive stuff out of it, revoking it will cause more harm then good. \n\nI didn't go six months without diagnosis, it took 3 weeks, my doctor said I had a stomach flue, idiot didn't even tell her to take me in, he just diagnosed me over the phone, now I get how he also didn't think about cancer last year, dumbed his ass after that one, so after a week of being sick on the first vacation, then sick at home for two weeks, my mom said we weren't cancelling the second vacation since I could be sick there too. So they stuck me in a car and took the whole family to the beach 3 hours away. Once there, my mom stuck me on the couch and went to the beach with my sisters. Leaving my dad and me behind to wait for his best friend and family. So the friend got there, he had seen me a month prior, healthy, and said that this wasn't something I should sick out at home. IDK how it went from there, I remember sitting in some docs office who kept asking me questions I couldn't answer because I felt like shit. Eventually I woke up in the hospital, IDK how long I was out, but I was hooked up, everyone crying and still felt like crap. Then they came in with an insuline pen and told me they had to stab me with it. Not explaining to the dumb 9 year old that they still had to put a needle on there so I freaked the fuck out since I thought they where going to stab me with a thick fucking pen lol. So another traumatic event later, I was treated, brought to the hospital in my home town and made aware with the doctors there."", ""My memories seem to be non-existent so it's crazy to me that I can visually remember what I was wearing the day I was diagnosed- a navy blue lion king sweatshirt with some jean shorts. It's harder to remember the shoes but I'm pretty sure they were white Keds, this was the early 90's.\n\n\nIt seems it was months before my mom took me to see a doctor. It was summer time and I would lay in front of a big fan eating nothing but Mentos, fading away... My parents even dragged me and the whole family to a water park one day. She was upset I wasn't going on anything. I felt like I was going to puke and pass out.\n\nHigh blood sugar. Blood sugar, something I'd soon become very familiar with.\n\nThe doctor I went to was a good one and sent me right away to get blood drawn. When my mom got the call from the doctors office, they said I'd need to be admitted to the hospital. I spent a week in the hospital- overwhelmed with information given to me and injecting oranges. \n\nI feel like diabetes has taken so much from me, and I'm pissed off too."", 'Not mad but a good story.

"It's not you, its diabetes.","I've been TID for 5 years. The 1st year my doctors didn't check my antibodies and where positive I had type two diabetes.  During this time my endo was ruthless, telling me things like ""you'll need injections in your eyes if you don't get this under control"" & ""you're knocking off years of your life"" and my personal favorite was when I was told to lose 30lb when I had just lost 20lb and weighed in at 110lb (because I was undiagnosed T1D). 

I couldn't shake the notion that I was failing myself. I wasn't in control at all, and I was constantly sick. Every time my chest hurt I was convinced ""this is it"". Every time my foot cramped I thought ""I won't be able to walk"". It wasn't until I got a new Dr. that I was diagnosed as type one. 

Since my Type 1 diagnosis I was put on insulin pens. I could never get my blood sugar under control. I was constantly chasing highs and lows. My average blood sugar was 223. I hated myself. I thought I failed myself. I was in a dark place because I was trying so hard and wasn't getting anywhere. I blamed myself and was in a dark place ready to give up.

Fast forward to 3 weeks ago, I got my first pump, the Tandem T:Slim. Since then, I've had complete control of my levels.  My average blood sugar is 110 (I know it's not perfect BUT ILL TAKE IT).

Then last Nov (2022) I switched to Omnipod 5... I had tried the Dash but hated it because it didn't have an auto control system. But when they released the Omni 5 I decided to try it. I absolutely love being tubeless, however I don't like the fact that I need a separate device to control the pump. With Minimed and tslim I got so used to having the control all in one unit but you have to disconnect for showers, swimming,hot tub. The tslim x2 is pretty compact though.\nI've been waiting for the Omni 5 compatibility with the Dexcom G7 but according to the company it could take another year. So I've been considering going back to the tslim once they get compatibility w/the G7 since it'll be sooner.  BUT now there is a new option - BetaBionics iLet insulin pump compatible with Dexcom G6. It's a tubed pump with automatic insulin dosing. You only enter your body weight, no basal or bolus rates, no corrections, no carb counting. Sounds scary I know but according to the results of the clinical trials the algorithm is really fast in learning the user's insulin needs. You charge it with a Qi charger and it uses an infusion set. Technically it's waterproof so you may be able to keep wearing it in water. I'm pretty sure the app is available for both iPhone and Android.

With the Omni 5 and Dexcom G6 my last A1c was 6.1. It seems like each time I switch to a new one, my control gets better but it could be due to my greater attn to detail with the new system. I would give most of the credit to the Dexcom CGM. When I switched from Minimed to Tslim my A1c improved quite a bit. Minimed uses their own CGM and now has the Minimed 780 pump and Guardian 4 CGM.   It's being touted as very accurate. \nOne other thing to consider is the closed loop system's blood glucose target.

Trouble Keeping Blood Sugar Down,"(Hope the formatting is okay- I usually post from my phone)

Hi everyone, I've had a rough 24 hours. I have not been able to keep my blood sugar down within my usual range for the life of me. The last 24 hours, my numbers have mostly stayed 170+, which is quite unusual for me. Correction doses seem to have little to no effect. When I finally do correct enough, it stays down for a bit before rising again. See pics for details. This morning, I woke up to 160 and it has risen to 208 now without me eating. Any ideas or insight as to what could be behind this? Thanks in advance.

Type 1.5 diabetes?(I’m not sure what to really call it),"So I’m 21 years old and about three months ago I started peeing a lot and eventually I dropped 20 pounds like it was nothing. Even a few nights I ended up wetting the bed(I’m sure many of us can relate to that-I hope😂😅.) Like many i didn’t realize it at first and dismissed it as a fluke or something. 

Well Father’s Day comes around and I ended up in the ER with a BG level of 688. I was throwing ketones and glucose in my urine but somehow wasn’t in DKA. So I finally made in to a PCP and they run their tests and at first think I’m T2. They prescribed me metformin and 10 units of long lasting insulin at bedtime. 

This changes once the rest of the autoimmune labs come back it shows I’m positive for all three antibodies but my PCP still thinks I’m T2. His argument is that since my metformin and insulin are doing a decent job of keeping me in healthy levels, there’s no way I can be T1 even though I have the antibodies. Then one day he says that he think it may be that I am T1 but I still have *some* beta cells left working. But then he goes BACK to saying it’s T2. 

From what I’ve seen, even within this community, is that I’m probably on borrowed time for my remaining beta cells so I was just wondering if anyone here has any advice at all for my situation or just has gone through something similar. It’s just really frustrating not having a true diagnosis.

With all three positive if you’re not strictly a T1 then you’d sooner extremely likely be a LADA than a T2 at any rate. (Which I doubt, you sound like a T1D based on current info) However, pretty much all T1’s go through a phase called the honeymoon phase. Your pancreas isn’t quite dead yet and it rather randomly still produces insulin, fighting the good fight. This can take weeks to months, but the end story is the same: it ends up dead (or well, the beta cells do). With LADA, this process is the same but it takes *a lot* longer. So you may do good on T2 meds first as a LADA; however, even T1’s in honeymoon can do alright on oral meds only for a while so that doesn’t say anything at all and your doctor should know better. \n\nAnyway, looking at the onset of your symptoms and requiring insulin from the get go: I’d classify you a T1D sooner than a LADA, but remotely diagnosing is impossible - hence the suggestion to try and get an answer from someone who isn’t challenged by a lack of knowledge on the subject; to put it mildly.

First day or two with the pump was fine but at some point it seems like his insulin sensitivity factor (correction factor) inexplicably increased a whopping 25-30x.

2-3 days back he had a severe stubborn crash from 250 to 45 even though we started treating him at 90. He did turn around eventually but it took a hell lot of carbs. The dose we had given him was only 0.2 units…

After we recovered, we saw that 0.05 units was causing a drop in BG of 100-150 points. Very erratic reaction to insulin dosing, but spike after carbs was typical.

Yesterday, he needed more insulin and seemed that his CF was a little lower. Today, few hours back though, CF has dropped back to near normal levels. Now 1 unit is bringing it down by 100-150 points.

Has anybody seen the ISF change so drastically and suddenly before?

Some observations:
1. This started around the time we went to the pump from MDI. 
2. We use Lily brand lispro in a vial in the pump instead of the kids humalog with the kwikpen. 
3. He did have a whole body allergic rash around the same time we went to the pump. A similar rash has happened a month ago too though when we were on MDI but his CF hadn’t changed this much back then.
4. No changes in his diet or activity level.
5. It could be honeymoon phase but weird that it would start/stop so suddenly and dramatically 2-3 months into diagnosis.

My suspicion is - could his body be having  a hyper sensitive reaction to insulin during those past couple days, perhaps related to the allergic rash? Or was the rash unrelated?

I’m worried his CF may dramatically increase again in future unexpectedly and cause him to have a severe low again. So would like to get to the bottom of this if any ideas.

But you can also dose smaller doses with it. So, I would work with a reduced correction factor and higher target goal for now.\n\nEspecially with children unfortunately there is a lot variety in insulin needs, also connected to all the growing hormones doing their work. With a pump and a CGM it is easier to observe and react accordingly. Also I recommend to be a bit more careful with BG corrections from a higher level, the CGM can be pretty inaccurate in that area. \n\nRemission phase can also play a role, it can happen a few months after diagnosis.', 'What is ISF/CF?', 'Thanks!

a couple of questions as a newly diagnosed t1,"Hello everyone!! 
A couple of questions
I believe I might be going through a bit of a honeymoon phase but Im not sure. The past few days I’ve been 100% in range, and since I started the dexcom it’s been around 85% in range with a couple of small highs here and there (never above 13) is that normal? I haven’t had a single low yet and I’ve been diagnosed since 27th may, despite me being very careless with my dosing sometimes.
For example the other day I injected 5 units of my rapid insulin, and then did not eat anything. (I know this is a bad idea I just wanted to see what happens) My levels were sitting around 8 or 9 before I did that, and barely came down afterwards, maybe sitting at about 6 like 3 hours later.
Sometime I just feel like I don’t even have t1d and they just messed up the tests or something. But I’ve confirmed with all my doctors, I definitely have the antibodies for t1d. Am I in denial? I don’t know. 
I also wanted to know if anybody struggles with an eating disorder on top of all of this? I struggled for YEARS with binge eating, purging, restricting but finally had gotten it all under control, and had a somewhat healthy relationship with food and my body, and the other day I had a proper appointment with a dietician who really went into depth into carb counting and gave me set amounts and I have fallen off the deep end. To be honest, I don’t know what to do. I’m struggling with everything so much and i guess nobody around me really understands the severity of it.

A Very Wet Misfortune,"Well…I finally did the thing I have always been so careful about not doing; I jumped into the pool with my pump connected. I don’t know how I didn’t realize, and, even worse, it was about 10 minutes of floating bliss before my arm rubbed against it and I had an immediate panic attack (not much of an exaggeration). I quickly dried it off and frantically googled, hoping for good news. According to the Tandem website, the pump is water resistant up to 3 feet/30 minutes. I was about 1/3 of the time and the depth (small celebration). I then found several people who apparently do all types of water sports in them and never have issues! *relief* 

About 90 minutes later, I went to put it back on- malfunction. A fatal malfunction. Instant tears at the thought of the nearly $4k it cost a year ago, which was only possible thanks to the generosity of my grandmother, and would not be attainable again for several months, at minimum. This pump has changed my life y’all. I was so resistant for years (more resistant than the pump, apparently), and finally gave in, wishing I had done so sooner. The thought of being without was devastating. How privileged I am to have it is not lost on me. Money should not be a barrier to optimum health! I called Tandem support and had the best representative who handled my blubbering with kindness and compassion, and was able to approve a no-cost replacement pump which will arrive in less than 48 hours.

Type 1 diagnosis after COVID,"Hello everyone, I hope you are doing well.

I was diagnosed in September 2022, after I was sick with COVID. I am the only one in my family with Type 1, everyone else who has diabetes is either pre-diabetic or type 2. I was wondering if anyone else had a similar situation to mine?

Clinical Trials,"Hello all,

I am reaching out to the community to inquire about clinical trials. 

I know very little about the process of what's involved. I'm wondering what information anyone might have regarding alternative treatments to Type 1 Diabetes. 

Also, does anyone have information about Type 1 in other countries and perhaps what alternative treatments they might be using to manage? 

I've lived with Type 1 since 1993. I'm 38 years old and live in California. I AM SO TIRED OF NEEDLES. I am so tired of the pain. I struggle with retinopathy as a complication among other nerve issues. 

To be fair, I'm reasonably healthy and could certainly have caused myself more issues had I not come to my senses later in life. 

I've just had this disease for so fucking long and it's wearing me out. Any sort of ideas, questions, or comments would help me greatly.

Sliding scale diabetes management whilst in hospital,I’m type 1 diabetic. In hospital for spine surgery. Had first surgery on Tuesday & they let me manage my own injections. I felt good. But now I need a second surgery & they put me on an insulin/glucose sliding scale in an iv drip. It’s keeping my blood glucose in the 6’s and 7’s. (Don’t know how that equates to USA readings). But I feel awful on it. Being constantly given glucose then insulin depending on my hourly blood glucose reading. Has anyone had experience of this? Thank you,https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14mc4sx/sliding_scale_diabetes_management_whilst_in/,"['I would say bring it up with your doctor honestly. As I understand it, when you are going to have surgery, having a high will increase your risk of a infection, prolonged stays in the hospital, and potentially even death. The intent of Sliding Scale, or VRIII(Variable Rate Intravenous Insulin Infusion) as it\'s ""officially"" called, is to minimize the likelihood of any potential chance of high BG when a patient is in a situation where their BG numbers will be unusually variable, like a diabetic hospital patient needing to minimize eating before a surgery. The amount of fluids in your body can also have an impact on the surgery and how your body handles it, so it isn\'t just glucose being given but also other ""body maintenance fluids"" so that when you go to the operating table, you 100% without any question aren\'t dehydrated or lacking in any specific thing your body needs like potassium.\n\nThough I just want to double check, but you do genuinely mean the 6-7 range, and not 16-17 correct? In mg/dl, that\'s about the 110-126 range, which is within the recommended range for type 1s if a bit on the upper end, being 4.5-7.2. The target range for Sliding Scale is actually 6-10 though, meaning you are within the ideal target range, if a bit on the lower side. Unless you are meaning that it isn\'t ""feeling too high/low"" that\'s bothering you, but the roller coaster of rising and falling constantly due to the IV? I know how a rapid rise and fall can hit you like a truck, so if you\'re rather sensitive to that sensation, I\'d imagine it must feel terrible. \n\nLike I said, I\'d genuinely bring up how you are feeling with your doctor. If it\'s what I mentioned before, that the IV is repeatedly over-correcting highs, then over-correcting lows and repeating, that\'s a sign the system isn\'t being used properly. If that isn\'t the reason you feel bad, well you still feel bad which means *somethings* going on. I\'d try to get some time to speak with the doctor, or head nurse, or whoever\'s in charge of your stay and let them know that you are feeling unwell, with it possibly being due to the VRIII. I\'d make sure to ask about *why* they have you on VRIII so that if they are receptive and are willing to genuinely listen to you, you can work out some sort of change to the system like how much it will deliver, or maybe even go back to personal management. \n\nThere\'s likely some sort of form you could request that lets you go back to personal management, with the note that if anything bad does happen, you signing the form means you can\'t blame the hospital for it. If you feel confident enough that you can genuinely manage your own sugars to the requirements the hospital wants you to be in pre-surgery, that\'s an option to ask about.\n\nThough ultimately I\'m just some dude online, so take my advice with a bucket of salt. The best solution for almost any problem involving other people is communication. Let the people watching over you know how you are feeling, let them know what you are worried about, and try to work with them to find an outcome that is ideal for both you and them.', 'I think it is a common practice in hospitals. As far as I know as long as you are able they also let you manage your glucose levels by yourself. Would you feel more comfortable like that?', 'Common in hospital settings.  Hospitals almost kill me with their sliding scales', ""Just curious, is 6-7 a bad range for you?

Yes I meant the hourly readings have all been 6-7. But it does feel like I’m going from high to low over & over. It’s 125 ml/hr of 4% glucose & 2 ml/hr of insulin.

I moaned about feeling lousy and they said it’s just till after the operation so there is hopefully an end in sight!', ""Remember that recommend ranges differ from country to country. Here in Sweden it is either 4-10 or 4-9.something (I forget exactly). When I was diagnosed in the UK it was 4-9.\n\nAlso being in that range isn't everything. If it is isn't level, more going up and down, due to the adding insulin and then correcting with glucose, it can make you feel quite exhausted.\n\nUnfortunately I doubt they will do much about it. With such a serious surgery as spinal they will probably prioritise healing over how the patient feels."", 'Thanks for replying. I hope they only keep me on it till I’ve had the operation & then I can manage it myself again. It’s just I’ve coped really well until now & I feel awful.', 'So sorry you experienced that.

Canadian programs for insulin costs?,"Hi all! I’ve been a type 1 diabetic for like 4 ish years now, I’m 26, and I just lost my job, aka my benefits. 

Do you know of any government programs (or any other things too) that pay for insulin / arm sensors? 

I’m located in southern Ontario (in Canada) so currently ADP covers most of my omnipod costs so I’m not worried about that, it’s my Freestyle Libre 2 & my novorapid insulin vials that are expensive and have no coverage now. I’ve never had to pay for supplies at full cost before and I can’t afford it bc EI pays nothing and i still don’t have a new job yet. also I’m not covered by OHIP anymore because I’m over 25.

Novorapid won\'t be covered, but biosimilar insulin aspart is.\n\nYou will pay 4% of your income as a deductible, then after that, no more than $2 ""per drug"" but I\'m not sure if they\'ll base if off your past income or current.\n\nYou may be able to purchase at shoppers and stack with PC Optimum points using the app on any portion unpaid. I\'m not sure if it\'s allowed for prescriptions, but it is if you buy over the counter. I used to buy Libre over the counter on 20x bonus point days (which is 30% back in points) and then once I had accumulated 200 000 pc points ($200 worth) I\'d wait for a redemption deal where I get $300 off my purchase when redeeming 200k points. Insulin and syringes can be bought this way as well. This is more of a long haul game but might as well start earning the points just in case. You can buy other stuff at shoppers to increase your point earnings. 3 Libres and 4 packs of insulin pens should get to close to 200k points for example, and then you\'ll essentially be able to able to get 2 libres and a pack of insulin free. I use pens so I\'m not sure how much vials cost but theyll probably be cheaper. Libres are $120 at shoppers but you get the points to use later. Check my post history for a breakdown. \n\nCostco also has cheaper Libres I\'ve read (80 to 90$).\n\nHope this will help tie you over until you get approved for the program/get a new job with benefits.', 'Also these will involve talking to your doctor but:\n https://www.novonordisk.ca/patient-help/resources-and-support.html they have a NordiCare program for financial assistance\n\nAnd\n\nADP also provides coverage for Dexcom under certain circumstances so you could try to see if you can get that as well.']"

One will cover it, the other won’t…but they don’t ever tell you that.', 'Your copay is gonna be petty set, I still pay 15% of my supplies that works out to ~$250 for dexcom every 3 months and $70 for tandem supplies. I get both from a durable medical supplier but dexcom doesn’t have to nor does omnipod. I have gotten my dexcom at the pharmacy before and it was the same price. But you will probably unlikely be able to get away from copays.', 'most insulin manufacturers have their own savings copay card, i’m not aware of any for omnipod or dexcom though. \n\nit’s worth checking what supplies are DME vs pharmacy. i believe omnipod 5 is only covered as a pharmacy benefit but dexcom might be covered under dme. \n\nwhen annual enrollment comes around compare plans with their deductible, max out of pocket and copays/coinsurance. i switched to a plan with a slightly higher premium (through the marketplace so my actual payment wasn’t that much more) because now i have a $0 deductible. if you haven’t met your deductible yet then you pay the contracted amount which can be higher than the amount with no insurance.', ""Omnipod is pharmacy, which is cheaper than DME. You can't lower your copay or deductible, because that is set by the plan you picked. What you can do is use your insurances preferred pharmacy and use their preferred method of prescription refill. Example, 30 day supply or 90 day supply. Also, instead of going through your insurance yourself, you can reach out to Omnipod and Dexcom and they will do the leg work of reaching out to your insurance and giving you the cost. That is what I did when I switched from Medtronic to Omnipod. The Omnipod and Dex reps did all the insurance haggling. They called me with what I would pay. Omnipod was 2k a year cheaper for me. So, I went with them. They took care of ordering the starter kits and my doc just wrote a 90 days supply prescription for the pods, sensor and transmitter. All 3 cost me 125 ea, every 3 months. Without insurance, transmitter alone is 1500 or 1800. My co pay is 45 bucks. I pay that for doc visits, my prescription cost of 125, is after insurance has paid their portion."", 'Insulet works with a place called ASPN that does some  insurance legwork for you, they might be able to help, considering they verify insurance/ coverage for Insulet (among other places, I would think).

Post meal rise,Hi everyone.  So something new that looks to be happening to my 8yo t1d son is a significant rise starting an hour or hour and a half after the meal.  He ate at 12 today with a 10 min prebolus.  Looks like it was going great and then the rise happened.  Happens with every meal.  This has never happened before unless he had some really fatty like pizza or French fries.  It's the same lunch he's been eating for a long time now.  Any thoughts?  Thanks!,https://i.redd.it/yginhua4109b1.jpg,"['Use an extended bolus and spread the insulin delivery out over a longer time.  Start with say, 50% up front and the other 50% over the next hour.  Adjust the ratio as necessary.\n\n\nAlso, you might want to change that high glucose alarm to a lower value so you can take action to correct it sooner.', 'How long has your son been diagnosed? And what kind of insulin are you using? \n\nI think for most kids on humalong / novalog, a 10 minute pre bolus is not nearly enough, I generally would like to see a drop off at dose time and then a quick rise. the lack of a significant drop on this graph at 12 noon indicates that perhaps the pre bolus isn\'t long enough.\n\nIf your son was recently diagnosed, the issue could be that honeymoon is ending and you need to adjust to post honeymoon diabetes.\n\nHow old is the pod? We typically see less responsive insulin on day 3 (and on a new pod) vs a pod that is 6-60 hours in use.\n\nDo you have a graph for the basal? With Loop (Omnipod but not o5) we run into this issue a lot when basal gets suspended for more than an hour. \n\nWhat was the lunch? are you sure your timings are accurate? I think it\'s pretty odd that a 8 year old eating at 12 noon would have a BG that is trending down until 1 p.m. That could make O5 ""think"" the lunch bolus was ""too strong"" and cause it to turn off he basal.\n\nEven if the lunch was not pizza, that trendline is indicative of a higher fat meal which is digesting slowly. It could also be the the dexcom is giving less than accurate reading (maybe the transmitter is close to 90 days)? \n\nIn general, meals should spike to 140-160 (even with O5) post eating (like 15-30 minutes after commencing eating), unless they are super low carb. If the meal doesn\'t spike it generally indicates the meal bolus is too strong (or there is an issue with the dexcom)', ""He's on omnipod 5 and dexcom g6, don't think I can do extended bolus unless it's in manual mode.  I usually so that with pizza tho so it's worth a shot.  Can't really do that while he's at school in August tho so I hope things go back to somewhat normal by then.\n\nAs far as alarm, I'm aware of his bg pretty much all the time unless I'm sleeping.   He went up to 220 before I did a small bolus and he's coming back down now.  It's so strange, like he started digesting carbs a lot slower or something."", ""About 2.5 years now and novolog.  He has a new pod on now and we're not having nearly as bad of rise after meals.  Weird, like once the bolus happened, the basal just wasn't being absorbed or something.  Still have the evening high a couple hours after dinner...but that's been happening off and on since diagnosis.  Probably hormones and/or fatty meals some days.  \n\nThanks for the response!  This new pod has been so much better, I should really get into the habit of changing it out sooner if these things happen to at least rule it out.  Hate wasting insulin like that though."", ""> like he started digesting carbs a lot slower or something.\n\n\nIt happens.  I can eat the same food with the same bolus and it comes out perfect, but there's always that one time where it sends my numbers into orbit and I can't figure out why.  \n\n\nI don't know if you have seen it yet, but [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qd0gLQ6W98) on youtube absolutely nails it.  It's pretty funny because it's all true."", ""yeah, you can draw the insulin out of the old pod if you really want to.\n\nAlso some people get accustomed to certain insulins - my daughter started having lots of weird readings on Humalog so we switched to Novolog and are day 3 issues when away. But now we are on FIASP and the day 3 issues are back (even though FIASP is just Novolog + b3 vitamins!)\n\nThat flat line for a meal is pretty impressive, what are you doing food wise? \n\nOn the post dinner rise, I don't know why this isn't better known, but BG / insulin needs are totally age dependent and for kids, there is a marked increase in insulin needs post bedtime thru the early morning hours. \n\n[https://diatribe.org/rules-engagement-basal-insulin-adjustment-or-avoiding-basal-blunders](https://diatribe.org/rules-engagement-basal-insulin-adjustment-or-avoiding-basal-blunders)\n\nDawn phenomenon is predominantly an adult issue.  My daughter goes from needing around .8-.9 units during the day to needing 1.4 units or more between 9 and midnight. (she's 9). So the evening high after dinner is totally normal, I'm not sure how the 05 algo handles kids, but I suppose you could cheat it a little and enter some phantom carbs at bedtime. But larger issue is, that rise is totally to be expected with an 8 year old, annoying that the omnipod5 doesn't handle it."", ""I'll give that a watch when I get back home,  thanks!  So he got a .3 bolus at 222 and now he's starting to low.  lol. Sometimes you just can't win, it's not enough insulin until it's too much.  😭"", ""We'll draw it out if within the first 24 hours,  but even when I try I maybe get half of it back.  Idk maybe I'm doing it wrong.  \n\nFor lunch, he has about the same thing every day with some rotations.  2 peanut butter jelly sandwiches with crust cut off, about a cup and a half of chocolate milk, lays chips and some fruit.  Comes out to 73 carbs."", 'Interesting - I have noticed we tend to get better results with higher carb meals - like Five Guys with a shake and fries and a hot dog tends to have a pretty flat line.   \n\n\nI think this gets back to O5 borrowing future basal to pay for bolus now. Like if you bolus 5 units and your basal rate is 1 unit per hour, O5 might bolus 5 or a bit more and then suspend / cut basal to keep you in range and adjust basal as needed.\n\nThere\'s also a good amount of fat in the PB + milk and chips which probably slows the digestion down.\n\nAlso, at the pre bolus, what\'s the typical BG? having a higher BG at pre bolus also helps with automated systems as the system is more willing to give a larger bolus if it thinks you are unlikely to be out of range soon (one of the ""downsides"" with Loop is it is very easy to sit in the 80-low 90s which makes bolusing hard).', ""It's  ~10 min pre-bolus and he's usually between 120-140 BG."", 'yeah, sounds like you have a pretty solid setup.\n\nAsk your endo to write the script for changing the pod every 2 days - mine suggested this to me so I think it\'s pretty well known in the endo world that pods don\'t always last 3 days. Also nice to have extra pods.\n\nI still like to pull the 80 hour pod now and then, but when in doubt, change the pod.\n\nYou might want to see if they have an extra vial of humalog to see if that performs better on day 3 (most insurance you can pay a bit extra for the nonapproved insulin, I think for us it\'s 120 vs 90 for a 3 month supply and for kids we only need to refill 2x a year so and extra 60 bucks for day 3 pod usage was worth it).\n\nwhat kind of a1c are you getting on Omnipod5? that graph looks great for a ""problem day"" lol', ""We have the 2 day script already just to have extras.  Didn't like cutting it close all the time before that haha.  \n\nHe was on Humalog the first year after diagnosis before insurance changed it to Novolog on us.  The best A1C on dash was 7.2 and on the 5 he's been floating around 6.8."", 'yup - great numbers! hopefully changing the pod more frequently helps!']"
