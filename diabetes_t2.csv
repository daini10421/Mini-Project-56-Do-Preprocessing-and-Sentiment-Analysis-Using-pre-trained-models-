New Rules (Medical Advice and Diagnosis),"Hello All,

Based on some recent posts we have added two new rules. 

1) No Seeking a Diabetes Diagnosis/No ""Do these symptoms look like Diabetes"": While we can fully appreciate the concerns over unusual symptoms. We are not doctors. It is best to speak with your doctor about your concerns.

2) No Giving/Requesting Medical Advice: We are not doctors and would not be aware of someone's full condition. If you need medical advice please seek out your doctor. As well please do not give medical advice other then to contact a doctor.

Please make sure to report any posts or comments you feel are breaking these rules. They are meant to keep people safe as like the rules say we are not doctors and should not be acting like them.

Thanks all!",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/vpp2or/new_rules_medical_advice_and_diagnosis/,[]

"In my (m39) 3rd week as newly diagnosed type 2, thoughts on needles","Hey everyone

Not seeking particular advice, just wanna share some thoughts and, I don't know, maybe get some feedback.

All my life, I have been afraid of needles, vaccinations etc. Not really in need of therapy just something I would have avoided at all cost. I was close to fainting whenever they took blood etc. 

That was before I was diagnosed with type 2 about a month ago. Since then, I'm not only somewhat more relaxed when having blood taken, but I also ""got used to"" (as much as that's possible) injecting insulin myself. Was a week in the hospital and the nurses did a wonderful job in somehow teaching and explaining to me all the stuff so I lose my discomfort.

Now to the point: What helped me a lot was using always these ""security needles"" where you don't see the needle stick out but ""shielded"" by plastic. They've used them in the hospital, and I use them myself now. I use the Autoshield 5mmx30G.

When ordering some Freestyle Libres they had some non-security needles (ie where you see the actual needle, not hidden behind a plastic cap) 4mmx32G.

I'm reading a lot since I've been diagnosed, so I was curious to use the shorter ones. They should be as good as per the latest research and I thought they are shorter and thinner, so why not give it a try?

Well, it took me about 5min to finally get the pen in (I'm only administering 1x day in the evening), and I got about 3 clicks out of 12 in. Then there was too much ""resistance"". Not sure I was too nervous or too tense on my leg, just didn't go. Using the security needle afterward worked as it used to, with no pain, and no issue.

Guess I don't have a particular question, since reading experiences helped me as well, I thought to share mine :) If anyone has some thoughts on maybe getting somehow used to the non-security needles, or why I should give it another try (maybe I'm as fine with the 5mm ones and don't feel a difference to the 4mm?!) let me know :)

Cheers!",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/14w5bjz/in_my_m39_3rd_week_as_newly_diagnosed_type_2/,"[""I have been very afraid of needles since I was a kid.

I was having a panic attack and pretty much hyperventilating. About 20 minutes in and still not being able to do it, my SO came home. He was in the kitchen and we were chatting and I was distracted enough to just push the button. And I never looked back. I went through pretty much the exact same thing with a CGM though I am still not a fan of putting them on. \n\nA few months back my T1.5 honeymoon was coming to an end and I was going to be started on basal insulin (Tresiba pen). Because of my background I was scared shitless, but went to the endo knowing I'd have to do it. It ended up being him showing me how to use it and having me do the first shot for real by myself. It was so much easier than finger-sticks and CGMs! I think it's the lack of control I feel with those spring mechanisms vs the extreme control I have using a pen needle. Whatever it is, I was thrilled ;)\n\nEach step of the way you are doing what needs to be done. We're all pretty resilient - you just have to give it a chance.""]"

Mom told to go to ER i dont know much about this stuff,"she had been feeling off since she got back from a trip, doctor usually prescribes her 2 pills but only gave her a 5 day supply of the second pill so she has to keep going back. Had not had it since wednesday and had noticed she started to feel very bad.

I made her go to the doctor today as no doctors open here on weekend. She tells me they want her in the hospital asap

I dont remember the number she told me but i think it was 400? 450? blood sugar level.

shes not been feeling nauseous at any point but shes been feeling chills sometimes and tired and general unwell.

The longer her blood sugar is at those high levels the more damage she is doing to her body and blood vessels. If she is in DKA she would be admitted and held until the doctors could return her blood sugar levels and get her other blood work under control. First they would do an initial set of blood work. From there, pending results they would lower her blood sugar by administering a very short acting insulin, give her IV fluids to rehydrate her, and possibly give her potassium or other electrolytes if she needed them. \n\nWhen this happened to me I was in the hospital for 6 days. I had a difficult case though, it could be a much shorter stay.\n\nIt's hard to say without any other information or blood work results.

This damn phenomenon is crazy,I've tried about everything. Not eating after 6 pm . Only eating from 10am to 6 pm. Nothing seems to help.

Feeling Sad and Worried,"So I am borderline diabetic ... numbers were just over the line, and it was easily brought down by changes in my diet. I'm still continuing to learn and adapt and make changes, but mostly I feel good about my progress.

I am in a relatively new relationship (18 months, long distance). This is BIG DEEP LOVE. I'm 65, maybe the biggest love ever. Super healthy, loving, hot relationship, deep communication, great sex, lots of laughter, and also lots of tears because both of us have had a hard and painful life with way too much death.

My partner was also diagnosed with diabetes, right about the same time oddly enough. She is a BIG sweet tea drinker. Everytime she drinks tea I feel like I am going to burst out crying. That sounds dramatic, but here's the situation. She has a heart condition, has had heart attacks, and is minimally interested in making the kind of changes she needs to make in order to live  a long/er life.

She also processes ""slow."" Meaning she is just someone that takes time to let information in. I'm the opposite ...medical junkie with access to medical journals. I am a big researcher, and fast adapter when it comes to my health.

She know how I feel. I have been clear with her that there is a limit to ""how close"" I can be with her because I know that if she continues eating the way she does (not terrible, but not what she needs to do to address her health concerns), and keeps drinking sweet tea (as in a quart a day) and other sweet drinks, it is just a matter of time before he lowish numbers go up, and I can imagine a cascade of medical issues ensuing. Oh she is on farxiga. I was able to enourage that after 5 months of suggesting, support, cajoling and our only ""fight"" ever. 

She listens when I talk. Makes some minor changes. Thinks about it. Sees my fear and sadness, but of course it is her life to live as she chooses, which I 100% believe.  How to let in the biggest bestest love ever, and accept where she is at, and protect my heart that has had so much loss and pain? This feels like such a conundrum.

"8.2 A1C to 5.3 off of meds (8 months total, last three months off meds) - thanks!","Just checking in to say thanks for this community. I'm the first in my family to develop T2, and it's been a very lonely journey. But this sub has helped immensely feel at ease and hopeful. Going to give my timeline for context for any other newcomers like I was:

Late 20's M -- In the last 8 months since I was diagnosed, I went from an A1C of 8.2 (209 fasting) to 5.2 five months later while on 500mg metformin the whole time. 

I was then taken off metformin for the last three months to see how I do. I was told if I go back to prediabetic around 6.0 that it's not too bad, and I may be able to stay off meds.

It was the three month mark today, and my A1C came back at 5.3 to my surprise! 

Since the start, I've also lost about 55 pounds and ran a 5.6k challenge run. While I still struggle greatly with my relationship with food, I'm eternally grateful for all the resources to help me get here.

A few pills becomes more and more or insulin and then complications.\n\nI‚Äôve heard the same general consensus from multiple sources. Lose 10% of body weight, eat low carb, and start a regular exercise routine. These 3 things can put you on the path to remission in weeks to months, if that is the goal. Worst case is a dramatic improvement in your stats. Maintain these changes and the disease may stop progressing. Fall off the wagon and it progresses.', ""Invest in a meter at the very least. Talk to your doctor about potential medication depending on how your body reacts to certain foods and how your sugar changes. Best thing to do when you first start is find out what foods your body can handle and which ones spike you.

Start listening to it. Tired suddenly? Check your levels and act on it. Stomach upset? Check your levels and act on it. It sounds easy, but it's not and will take some time to understand what's going on. Feeling stressed? Check your levels and act on it. \n\n**Start Moving** \\- You don't have to start running marathons or working out for 3 hours a day right now. But start moving more. My condos are split up into different lots, each with its own dumpster. I started taking the trash to the next lot over. Get a daily chore list and do them, even if it's just 10 minutes of sweeping and dusting for maintenance. Little things go a long way. I worked my way up and now walk at least 2 miles a day just for fun. \n\n**Understand what you eat** \\- I know it seems like you can't eat anything you enjoy. You will be surprised at how much you still can eat once you understand how things interact with the disease. You don't have to cut out everything, and some stuff you thought you might have to cut out is fine in moderation. There's lots of dietary advice out there, some of it contradictory. If in doubt, you can ask your doctor. \n\n**No Stupid Questions** \\- My doctor told me this. Her brother was diagnosed and didn't tell anyone or ask anything, causing him to be miserable. She made sure to tell me there are no stupid questions and to ask her or a group like this about anything, no matter how silly or trivial you think it may be. \n\n**Don't Panic** \\- Your numbers will be all over the place when you first start meds. Testing 170 at 8am and 120 at 11am can seem like a huge shift, but it happens. You can test for 90-100 for 3 days straight then wake up to a 150 without warning. Keep track and you'll start to see more predictable numbers as you get better managing your diagnosis.  \n\nThat's all I could think of for now, but I'm still new to all this too."", ""If taking medication, take them, some will have mild effects, but the go away quickly.\n\nEat better, reduce and remove carbs from your diet; remove rice, pasta, white bread, sodas, breakfast cereals, sweet fruits ... \n\nHydrate, drink water.\n\nExercise, don't go bonker, a small walk after eating will help.\n\nGet a glucometer, test yourself regularly, usually in the morning when wakingg up and 2 hours after eating, keep a log of the numbers to track your progression."", 'It‚Äôs totally manageable.

Contour Next,"I've been doing lots of research lately on accuracy of my Dexcom G7 CGM. I learned about MARD and how it's a number that can be used to compare accuracy across devices. Tonight I found the MARD for some blood glucose monitors. I wanted to make sure I was using the most accurate meter since I use my finger stick reading to calibrate my G7. According to this study, the Contour Next has the lowest MARD which means it's the most accurate. It's what I have been using. My last A1C was only 2 points different in average blood sugar compared to my CGM average. I'd say that's very accurate over 3 months.

Pairing your food mattered a lot for me. I can't just eat some berries and be ok. I have to eat protein first and then have a few berries. Think clean protein like chicken or fish and green veggies.

Just Diagnosed,"My doctor's lab worker told me over the phone that I have diabetes this morning. 

Four years ago, my doctor warned me that my blood sugar was too high and I was prediabetic. I started walking more and cut way back on the carbs and sugars. For a while, I was doing well. I lost weight and my blood sugar went down. During this time, I was using Samsung Health to keep track of my food and exercise, as at the time, it had a real time calorie tracking tool that would tell me if I was in the green, yellow, or red zone.

Then Samsung removed the helpful tool from their app, leaving me without a compass. I continued the same for the most part. Was I perfect? No. I would still eat junk food from time to time. However, I did walk for about 20-30 minutes just about every evening. 

This past winter, somehow my weight went back up and with it the blood sugar. I'll admit that I ate rather indulgent Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners, but figured it'd be OK as long as I exercised. Last February, I weighed in at 222 lbs! Yikes! So I started walking even more and added 3 lbs hand weights into the mix. 

As of my last weigh-in at my doctor, I was down to 206 lbs. I felt like I was headed in the right direction, but then got my lab results back and it says my blood sugar is too high and now I have Type 2 diabetes. How can I have this if I'm losing weight? 

Breakfast: Wheaties in lactaid milk, a swallow of OJ

Lunch: Chicken or tuna salad sandwich on whole wheat, lactaid milk

Dinner: hearts of romaine salad, coleslaw, baked beans, sabra classic hummus, plain greek yogurt, hard boiled egg, applesauce, banana, apple, lactaid milk

I'll also admit to having developed quite the fondness for Coke Zero. After all, if it has no sugar or carbs, it has to be OK, right? However, I've also heard rumblings that artificial sweeteners may actually cause the same reaction as sugar does? https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/is-coke-zero-bad-for-you#nutrition Do I need to give it up altogether, or is cutting back to say once a week OK?

When to start medication?,"Does anyone know the current science/medical opiniom about when to start medication for T2D?

I ask because I was diagnosed in 2021 with numbers like 126 fasting and 6.5 A1C. Then in early 2022 I had diverticulitis for the first time, was hospitalized, had great difficulty for a year with continued pain and anxiety from that. I lost 30 lbs from being scared and not eating. Cue my new doc (my prev quit) and he says my numbers are fine and I don‚Äôt have diabetes. I inquired about a GLP-1 for weight loss and he acted like I was drug seeking and kept gaslighting me about having diabetes. Now, to today, I‚Äôve gained all that weight back and my fasting has been 129-144 and my post-prandial has been like 200-215. I just came back from my new-new doctor and she says I don‚Äôt need metformin yet but I can take it if I want.

My question for you - is that really the most up to date treatment? To not medicate at these lower levels such as fasting being at 130?

I know you aren‚Äôt my doctors and mine told me I can do whatever, but I also have a lot of anxiety about medication and I need a push to take it. When my doctor just kinda shrugs about it, I don‚Äôt really know what to do.

Shocking first A1C update!,"I was diagnosed back at the end of March this year and I was very sick. My A1C was 14! Blood sugars of 300+ average. I took this very seriously as I had seen what type 1 did to my grandma. And I know type 1 and type 2 are two very different beasts, I did not want to have to give myself insulin as well as not wanting any other medical problems from this. I was given metformin 2000mg/day and glipizide. After a month I asked to be on Ozempic to help with weight loss(was given Wegovy at first, but thats another story, now on Ozempic lol) So I was taken off glipizide and started the semaglutide injections. (which aren't so bad needle wise!)

The first night I checked my sugars it was 385. I made dramatic changes to my diet. No sugary drinks, cut most carbs, ate more chicken/tuna. Only drinking zero sugar sodas every now and then, drinking mostly flavored water with zero sugar flavors.

 The fall from 385 was not easy. I felt horribly sick as if I was going hypoglycemic. Ofc I was not, but my body had been at those levels for a while. My vision had changed drastically, going from not being able to see farther things, to not being able to see up close, to being able to see just fine, to now needing my original prescription glasses. I developed a kidney stone around a month in as well so a lot of medical issues hitting all at once. 

If we eat fast food I cut things in half and eat small portions through out the day. I loved discovering sugar free foods because I felt so devastated at the beginning about losing all my favorite foods/drinks. My favorite is sugar free chocolates and Milo's sugar free sweet tea! A real treat as they taste no different than regular chocolates and sweet tea. For exercise I mostly walked. 

Today I had my checkup to test my A1C again. I was expecting 7-8 as I did have some moments of weakness... and bread. It was 5.7!! Still ""pre diabetic"" range but I am so very happy! I will get this under control! I am going up in mg. for my Ozempic and if all goes well I will be lowering my metformin next month when I see my doctor again. Sorry for wall of text haha just so excited!

I've had T2 for 5 months now,"I was originally diagnosed with T2 in February after a Christmas COVID illness that developed into pneumonia. Neither me or my doctor at the time knew I was diabetic, so they put me on this cough syrup that was quite sugary, and all of a sudden my vision got blurry and I didn't know what to do. I ended up going back and they diagnosed me with T2 with an A1c of 10.5%. I was devastated. 

They prescribed me 500mg metformin taken twice daily with combo of diet and exercise. I took that moment as a kick in the teeth that I needed and did a drastic diet change. No soda, pasta, pizza, or empty carbs. My vision returned to normal pretty quickly, thankfully, but I still had/have a long way to go. I made a vow to exercise at the very least 3 times per week, preferably more. I drink a ton of water, eat as many greens as I can, and low glycemic fruits like blueberries and grapes, with the morning banana thrown in there. I eat healthy choice power bowls for lunch (my favorite is the chicken marinara) and dinner is usually whatever we have around the house made healthy. I also love Greek yogurt now. 

My result is a current A1c of 5.4% and a weight loss of 60lbs. This is the hardest thing I've ever done and I wish that I was better enough when I was younger to be healthier, but I'm still proud of my progress. 

It gets easier over time, and it's definitely a lot of trial and error, but I'm slowly getting used to the healthier lifestyle. I still get doomer about it sometimes, but places like this sub and people showing their progress has really helped me keep going. 

For those who also got diagnosed this year, I know it's hard to come to terms with, but it gets easier the longer you go. You just gotta stick to it! People love you and you deserve to be on this earth for as long as possible. You're worth it üëç

So I have to keep my peak time below 160.\n\nFood can be divided in 3 groups,  simple carbs will raise blood glucose higher and faster, complex carbs will also raise it but a slower rate and not as high.  They also tend to be more nutritious. And proteins, this will affect blood glucose the least. \n\nIf you don‚Äôt have a meter, get one. And make it your friend.  It is recommended, at least while learning, to test first thing in the morning, before meals and two hours after first bite of a meal.  This so you learn how different foods affect you.  Eat according to what your meter is telling you and you should be ok.\nI use a ‚ÄúContour Next One‚Äù  it syncs to a phone app and it makes it a lot easier to track your progress. \nWalking is the best exercise.

Catastrophically bad idea. Wish me luck.,"I'm sure this post needs a warning that this is a BadIdea‚Ñ¢ but I'm giving up on good ideas.

Since November Ozempic has been impossible to get hold of reliably in the UK. I know it's bad worldwide, but the NHS has told doctors that it's going to be AWOL for another 6-12 months since the only supplies coming in to the UK are getting snapped up by private clinics giving it to people who want to lose weight.

Rybelsus (or however it's spelt) has gone the same way. Victoza (which worked but had side effects for me and my shitty schedule) has now gone onto a protected list and they aren't allowed to put new patients on it.

My only options are a pill you need to take 20 minutes before food (good luck mixing that with ADHD), one that's pretty much guaranteed to give me thrush, one that will fuck me up if I don't drink enough (which I never do, hello ADHD), or insulin. Which I'm told will put weight on.

So, I've told the Dr to stuff it. If they can't do healthy treatments, I don't see why I should either.

Aside : my wife is seriously overweight and pre-diabetic, and has been put on a hospital diet that involved nothing but milk or fortisip, a vitamin supplement, and a salt supplement. She's lost significant weight on it and is now having solid food reintroduced, apparently as a keto style diet.

Back to the insanity: so... Fuck it. I'm going for intermittent fasting. One day of keto and two of a milk diet.

I need to upgrade my finger prick to a machine that monitors ketones too, but I'm going to give this a try.

I've already been told by drs that I ""just need to lose 15% to see things turn around"" but I'm already down from 154kg to low 120s which is 20% and just got a 72 HbA1C. Let's see what happens if I get to 100kg. That would give me a BMI of 28, so still ""overweight"" on this stupid bloody scale.

I guess this will either be a fun journey or a lesson in how not to treat diabetes.

Obviously, pharma would prefer you control diabetes with their newest and most expensive drugs (e.g. Ozempic/Rybelsus or other GLP1 agonists).

I think it's frustrating that you're unable to continue on what sounds like your preferred method (Ozempic).\n\nI'd be careful with fortisip, though.  Did a quick google search and it looks like it would be horrible for diabetics:  Half the calories in it come from carbs (and then half of that is pure sugar).  Then 1/3rd of the calories in it are from fat, but that's rapeseed oil or sunflower oil, which aren't ideal.

I know it has worked wonders for me.\n\nI am not so sure about doing two days of a milk diet and then a day of keto. Milk has lactose which is a combination of glucose and galactose, two monosaccharides. Glucose is what you are trying to get out of your blood. Losing weight will definitely help control your diabetes, but it seems to me that doing a milk diet is probably not the best way to do so.\n\nOf course, I am not a doctor so take this all with a grain of sand. I think you would probably benefit more from just cutting carbs (whether they come from table sugar, starches/complex carbs, or milk) down to 20g of less a day everyday. Replace those carbs with protein and healthy fats. You will feel satiated longer, lose weight, and control your diabetes more effectively.\n\nWhat I do is keto and intermittent fasting. I am particularly stringent with carbs. I generally keep my carb intake under 5g carbs per day, some days zero. I follow an 18/6 intermittent fasting regimine. I eat my first meal between 11am and 1pm. Then I eat my last meal between 5pm and 7 pm (depending on when I ate my first meal). I will sometimes not even eat the second meal because I am not hungry. I don't snack. It took several weeks to really break the carb addicition though. \n\nI lost 50 pounds (from 320 to 279 as of Saturday) since mid January doing this. And my last A1C was 5.6%.

I do walk pretty briskly, but I don't get out of breath or anything.\n\nAgain, I am not your doctor and I don't know what all other things you have going on. How you choose to control your diabetes is up to you. I do encourage you to cut non-veggie carbs down and then out of your lifestyle. Carbs are not essential.

Would hba1c be affected by recent food intake?,"Want to know if hba1c would have any effect with recent food.

I‚Äôm not a doctor but I see that since April 2021 when my dad first started Atorvastatin after stent placement he‚Äôs on fast track to diabetes.

Newly Diagnosed. A1C 10.1% Ozempic vs. Wegovy? Normal blood sugar range?,"Last year I was prediabetic with A1C of 6.4%. I didn't change any of my habits and low and behold, putting off the blood test for diabetes led to an A1C of over 10%. I've been taking metformin 750mg for PCOS for almost two years now. I've kept that and added 0.5mg of Ozempic injections once a week. 


I guess my question is, people use wegovy, at a much much higher dose of a whopping 2.4mg, simply for weight loss. I'm wondering, since I'm approved by my insurance, with PCOS, diabetes and obesity; why wouldn't I start the higher dose Wegovy treatments? I've cut out sugary drinks, fast food and heavy carbs (it's been a week since my diagnosis) and my blood sugar with the blood glucose monitor typically stays around 200-230mg/dL with my lowest coming in at 175mg/dL after overnight fasting. 


Is my blood glucose too high to have been 200+ for an entire week? Would this mean I need to increase the metformin or Ozempic? I have a follow up with the doctor in another week and my blood glucose monitor keeps track of my trends via an app so I have that to show.


Anything else I should be aware of? I'm definitely going to be reading a lot more on this page to get up to pace and more informed. 


Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/14q3re1/newly_diagnosed_a1c_101_ozempic_vs_wegovy_normal/,"[""You probably don't need more medicine. If you are struggling to get under 200 glucose levels, it points to your diet. You are probably eating way  more carbs than you realize. I suggest keeping your carbs under 50g per day. Try completely cutting out the big offenders at first: rice, pasta, potatoes, bread, most crackers, sweet drinks (including juice), cereal, bananas and of course, all junk food. Start reading labels. Don't look for sugar count, look for carb count. Plenty of sugar free items out there that are absolutely loaded with carbs. Keep in mind, just because something is natural, doesn't mean it is healthy for you personally. Drink water. Lots of it. Portion control is also important. \n\nOnce your glucose is under control, weight will really start to drop off of you, and your body will start to feel better in so many ways. The first 2 weeks are rough but after that you stop craving all the carbs. Losing weight will lower your numbers too. Going for a walk after you eat can help combat post meal spikes. Exercise is medicine."", ""You will be titrating up until you hit the right dosage. Taking 2.4 mg wegovy without titrating up to it is a pretty safe recipe for a trip to the ER and actually to get hospitalized with kidney failure. Please be careful even if you started right away with 0.5 mg (which would have killed me) and felt fine. The effects could just hit you on a higher dosage. I've heard people telling that kind of story. \n\nThe medication is also building up in your system for 4 weeks. If you take the same dosage for 4 weeks you reach then the highest level in your system. This is due to the half life of ozempic of about 7 days. So, it doesn't make sense to judge the dosage you are on before 4 weeks are over. I'm not sure how long you've been on it. But just keep that in mind also for future reference. \n\nI'm relatively sure, that your doctor will titrate your dosage sometime in the near future. He'll see that your bs isn't yet where it's supposed to be and he'll take measures for that. I'm t2d and I've been on it for 7.5 months now and I'm just now titrating up to 1 mg. A few side effects hit me harder than the average user. You seem to have fewer side effects than most people. But really if you do experience them you will understand why your doctor is doing this carefully. I'd trust your doctor here. \n\nYou can also ask for an increase of the metformin. Metformin max level in my country is 2000. I take 1000 in the morning, 1000 at night. 750 seems actually a very low dosage for someone having such serious problems with bs for obviously some time now. My highest a1c was 6.4 and they maxxed out the metformin long before I got there. As a pcos person I know that IR is probably your main problem and metformin helps best for that. But as both medications can cause GI problems, it's probably not very advisable to play around with both at the moment. Just discuss with your doctor. \n\nYou didn't get here in a day and it'll take some time to get to a better level.

You needs to get with a Diabetes educator and dietician. They can help you adjust to new way of thinking about diabetes, diet and exercise. And you can do this, for it is hard to change to lower the BG, for meds cannot do it alone. Changes are great and helpful to help lower the BG and the A1c.

You can do this, but it does take time to adjust.', "">I guess my question is, people use wegovy, at a much much higher dose of a whopping 2.4mg, simply for weight loss.\n\nVery simply because you titrate up. You should be on the lowest dose for four weeks. Assuming you are tolerating it well, because those meds can have some pretty heavy side effects for some people, you would call your doctor and request to go up to the next. And do that every four weeks. But you may get on a dose, like the .5, and decide you can tolerate the  side effects and you are getting blood glucose control/weight loss and you stay on that dose for however long. If you plateau, if your BG isn't coming down, if you're hungry all the time, then you could speak to your doctor about going up.\n\nOr you may go up to the higher dose and decide you can't tolerate the side effects and come back down one. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Anything else I should be aware of? \n\nI was on Ozempic and Rybelsus which are both Semaglutide. Not at the same time. But I was on Metformin ER and Jardiance with them. My BG wasn't coming down below 6. The doctor wasn't concerned about that, she was happy considering that was five or six months after my diagnosis with 11. I had also stalled with weight loss. We switched me to Mounjaro. Weight loss kick started again and my BG dropped to 5.2. I've since been able to discontinue Jardiance and Metformin.\n\nBut this is the key. Some people do very well on Ozempic/Wegovy and some people do really well on Mounjaro. And then unfortunately some people cannot tolerate the side effects. Be aware there is another option out there for you, though Mounjaro seems harder to get covered. But you can discuss it with your doctor if you want. And discuss basically what you've asked about going up to a higher dose of your current med. \n\nAgain, the simple answer is because you have to start on the lowest dose."", '[deleted]', ""I would really look into your diet.

My t2 diabetes journey,"7 yrs ago I was diagnosed as t2 diabetic with an a1c of 6.9. My dr wrote me an Rx for metformin, but I told her I would do it with diet alone (I was a vegan at the time, and had been one for many years).

I tried lowcarb but it was hard bc unknown yet to me and my dr, I had severe sleep apnea, which can cause food cravings for sugar and starches.

The following year they found out I had sleep apnea. Once that was treated, lowcarb became much easier bc my appetite changed to not want anything sweet or starchy.

Today my a1c is 4.9 and has been for several years.

My diet for 6 yrs has been very low carb and higher fat from natural meats, eggs, etc. I'm the total opposite of a vegan now, and all my health issues are gone: hypertension, weight gain, fatty liver, high eye pressure that could've led to glaucoma, brain fog, fatigue, and more.

We talked about why he felt so overwhelmed and it basically boiled down to he feels like an idiot because he didn‚Äôt even know what I was talking about when I told him to avoid starchy foods.  SOooo! I went online and printed him three lists of foods : green light ( meats, eggs, fats, etc) stuff with minimal impact on blood sugar, yellow light stuff to go easy on ( fruit, beans , etc).  And stuff that I will kick your butt if you eat it ( anything with  high fructose corn syrup, sugar, white bread, pasta).  Also gave him a crash course on exactly WHY high sugar is so bad and the long term effects. 
He told me he ate exactly what I told him to all week and he weighed himself and was 10 lbs lighter.  We checked his fasting blood sugar and it had already dropped by 10 ( 150 to 140).  I also taught him to check his own blood sugar. 
He was so relieved he cried and said he can keep this up now that he knows it works.

Newly diagnosed in the UK. What can I expect?,"So newly diagnosed yesterday. My doctor got my first blood results Friday and rang to send me to Same Day Emergency Care which confirmed it all. Was a little concerned at the Docs warning that ‚Äúsome people become very poorly very quickly and that‚Äôs why they want to see you‚Äù, no idea if that‚Äôs the standard thing or not!
My HbA1c was 108 (12%?) and I didn‚Äôt really learn much from the doc there, just that all my other blood tests came back fine and normal is below 42.

Firstly it‚Äôs a relief to be diagnosed, had odd symptoms for a long while but did nothing about them until I lost 9kg (19.8lbs) in a few weeks, most of it seemingly muscle from my arms and legs, I look like a twig with a belly now! Also developed a raging thirst and was putting down a stupid amount of water, particularly at night. To be honest I never connected the previous symptoms of things like sudden crashes, tiredness and things to anything but this diagnosis explains a lot. 

My diet isn‚Äôt that bad, it‚Äôs balanced but I eat loads of everything and am overweight, another 8kg to lose. Was always fairly active until an injury in Jan but building up to gym and cycling again. I‚Äôm pretty much addicted to fizzy drinks and Monster so strongly suspect that may be to blame coupled with the extra weight. Cut those out almost completely in the last week and started to look at my diet already, also taken my first dose of Metformin and not planning on being further than 10ft from the loo all day!

The big question is what happens now?
Repeat bloods to check the dose I understand but will I see specialists, dieticians or am I going to be sent on my way after I see my doc Thursday? Beyond the near future and any help/advice is there any long term care or help available? Realistically how quickly do positive lifestyle changes take affect on the body? Is the fact I potentially had it for a fair while already likely to make it harder to deal with? And most importantly, do any of the treatments stop the thirst and consequent need to pee all night long as I want a full nights sleep?!?",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/14okepv/newly_diagnosed_in_the_uk_what_can_i_expect/,"[""Start reviewing your diet, cutting carbs (sodas, sweets, rice, pasta...)\n\nExercise regularly, don't go bonker.\n\nand control your weight.\n\nTake your medication, keep at it, the usual side effects go away after a few weeks.\n\nMeasure you blood glucose daily ( multiple times per day at the beginning)\n\nDiscuss with your doctor the blood glucose target you should aim for at short, medium and long terms.\n\n[https://www.diabetes.co.uk/type2-diabetes.html](https://www.diabetes.co.uk/type2-diabetes.html)\n\nFor me, the thirst and peeing nearly stop immediately as soon as I started taking medication and eating better; I even forget to hydrate during the day."", 'You\'ll have a few appointments with the doctor to check you are stabilising and checking what your finger prick tests are coming in at, checking on ketones if you have any.  Discuss if you are doing ok on metformin, if you aren\'t on ER probably switch it. \n\nAfter that it will be 3 month A1cs (blood tests, pee samples, foot checks, weight and height) and discuss with the nurses here, refer back to the doctor if the results need a change in med doses etc. \n\nI was NOT sent to an Endo, but they did C-peptide and antibody testing to be sure I was T2 in that first week.  I was given a finger test glucose machine, and have been refused a CGM because its this trusts policy that there are ""too many T2s, we can\'t give them to you no matter how many times you test"", something echoed in other areas by friends, but you *can* ask and see just in case. \n\nYearly you\'ll have a special diabetic eye screening to check for retinopathy. Remember to be able to get home safe after as they suggest you don\'t drive afterwards for several hours as it changes your vision because they dilate the eyes. \n\nYou\'ll be sent on - or pleas ask for - a diabetic education class. It goes through the basics of how the illness works, then spends the second half telling you everything fat and calorie is evil and to cut carbs and eat more veg. (take the high fat and calorie bit with a pinch of salt - you still need to eat enough and fat is actually fine as long as you aren\'t overeating. I had the issue I was *losing* weight due to the insulin resistance and struggling to eat more than 1200 calories so sat through that bit a bit dumbfounded as to what the hell I WAS allowed to eat then...). \n\nSince you have lost weight recently whilst your blood sugar is out of control its normal to gain a little back as you stabilise - don\'t think of this as failure! You can work on weight loss after stabilising and getting an idea of how different things affect you and what exercise you can or can\'t do. \n\n(note: diagnosed North East England, End of 2021). \n\nResults from changes: as your blood sugar comes down you should stop the peeing constantly and thirst almost immediately, at most a couple of weeks, but basically almost as soon as you start hitting regularly below around 10mmol on your tester.  You will feel TIRED though, if you\'ve had higher sugars for a while its exhausting at first to have normal ones and will take some adjustment, be kind to yourself and be prepared to take a few naps, be careful increasing exercise and ensure you aren\'t overdoing it at first and tell others at home you might be a bit low mood for a bit (but obviously try to control the snappiness)', ""\\> And most importantly, do any of the treatments stop the thirst and consequent need to pee all night long as I want a full nights sleep?!?\n\nYes that can resolve quickly - those two symptoms (really the same symptom) are a short term result of VERY high sugars. Your body is trying to push the sugar out (thus the pee.. which requires water intake to keep up with).\n\nIf you bring the levels down from the VERY high levels this will abate. The doctor won't let them stay that high long - they'll apply insulin if they have to. If they fail to do that you'll end up hospitalized with (at least) diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and/or pancreatitis.\n\nSo the thirst will  improve and the weight loss will also improve fairly quickly (in days typically).\n\nThe lifetime problem for most diabetics is high blood sugar.. less than those critical levels - but doing damage over time to your kidneys, toes, eyes, heart etc.. having elevated levels over time leaves you at high risk for blindness, neuropathy, kidney failure, strokes, heart attacks, etc.. serious stuff!\n\nSo you need to work hard (how hard depends on how bad your disease is which, just like cancer, varies from person to person.. this isn't fair. and typically it gets harder over time) with diet meds and exercise to get those sugars down to good consistent levels. 6.5% A1C is where you really want to be. 7.0% is pretty good. Some people obsess with healthy (non diabetic) levels of 4.5% or 5.0% but 6.5% is really where the correlations with complications begin - focus on getting there. This part won't happen super quickly, it will be easy to ignore (you'll probably feel fine with an 8.0% A1C) and will be hard to maintain. But it's important.\n\nyou got this. Don't forget exercise - it really helps but gets talked about less (mostly because the majority of patients aren't willing to do it)."", 'As an update, got called into hospital today with an hours notice.

VA Doc put me on meds after lab work,"Hey y‚Äôall. I‚Äôve been on metformin 500mg 2x daily for about a month now and really have no idea what I‚Äôm doing. The VA wrote me a prescription and gave me a glucose monitor‚Äîthat was it, other than doc telling me to cut out soda and walk 30-mins. I rarely drink it anyway.

Anyhow, should my doc have given me more guidance? After reading some posts here, I really feel like the VA is nothing more than a bunch of pill pushers.

My a1c was 8.4 and fasting glucose was 190 when they did my bloodwork. The glucose monitor they gave me came with 10 strips and replacements were expensive. To cut costs I picked up one from cvs which had cheaper strips. Over the last month reads have been anywhere from 110 to 340.

When you were 1st diagnosed, was it a similar experience with your primary care? I‚Äôm wondering if I should just find a new doc outside of the VA Healthcare system.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/14o9jc0/va_doc_put_me_on_meds_after_lab_work/,"['Many doctors know a Dx of T2 diabetes is hard for many patients to accept and fully understand and may actually limit what they say at the start.

For some it‚Äôs the only thing they do.  Sounds like you are tolerating it ok and you understand the value in testing your BG.  Always test your morning fasting value as it‚Äôs an indicator or how well you are doing.  Testing an hour after meals gives you an indication of what specific foods may be causing your BG to spike.  Usually your doctor Will target a range from 70 to 180 for your BG sticks as an acceptable level.\n\nYour A1c tells your average BG % over about the prior 3 months.  As a T2 usually your doctor will target you below 7.0.\n\nTry to cut your carb intake not just sugar but potatoes, rice, bread, pizza, pasta, etc.  Try to increase your exercise especially after large meals.  Even short quick walks will burn glucose and lower the BG spike.  Work to reduce your stress levels.  Stress whether work, emotional or illness raises your BG levels.\n\nTesting your morning fast, prior to a meal and 1 hour after a meal in the beginning is helpful.  Ask for a larger RX on test strips.  Most insurance will pay for at least one strip per day.  Often more if you are on diabetes medications.  As you have found cheaper meters and strips are often available.  Walmart ReliOn brand is frequently mentioned.\n\nI know a Vet who uses the VA and he gets great care and was enrolled in a special online diabetics clinic for a while.

Getting a meter with cheaper strips was the right thing to do. The cheapest is the Walmart ReliOn brand. I chose a Contour Next ONE, which is slightly more expensive but supposedly slightly more accurate.\n\nDiet and exercise will be your biggest allies. 30 minutes of vigorous walk a day can really help. It's even better if you can manage 20 minutes after each meal. You will get lots of ideas for food here. Most of it will boil down to cutting down sugar and carbohydrates in general, except fiber. Look at net carbs (total minus fiber minus a percentage of sugar alcohols). You'll need to figure out how low to cut carbs based on where you are. But you should avoid bread, potatoes, rice, and anything starchy.\n\nIf your BMI is over 30, you need to try to drop some weight. The exercise and metformin will help.

I had Ibs-d before hand, so i didn't notice any change in bowel movements.  good luck with your surgery."", ""I had a gallstone and a gallbladder attack.  I was told I needed surgery.  Thankfully I have a history of being told incorrect information from doctors more than I have been told correct information, so I double checked the facts:\n\n1. Surgery has a fatality rate attached to it and lifetime complications.  Around 8% of people who get their gallbladder out have lifetime complications, a restricted diet, and they have to take pills for life. \n\n2. You can take ursodiol to dissolve the gallstone.  No surgery needed.  (There is an over the counter equivalent you can get too.)\n\n3. They push surgery on you because it's more profitable, not because it's the safer option.\n\nI chose to go the ursodiol route.  I went to a gastroenterologist, got a prescription for ursodiol and after 6 months the gallstone was gone.  No lifelong issues or risk of death.\n\nHow it works:  \n\n- When you don't eat enough fat in your diet the gallbladder isn't used.  If it isn't used for long enough a gallstone can form.  This is how most people end up with gallstones.  \n\n- When you have a gallstone you can't use your gallbladder, or the stone might get stuck in your gallbladder and you'll need emergency surgery, so you have to be on an ultra low fat diet right now.\n\n- When taking ursodiol it needs to replace the bile in your gallbladder to dissolve the stone, so you need to be on a reasonably high fat diet when taking ursodiol.  I recommend taking it right before the start of a fatty meal.  For me my diet consisted of lots of fatty red meat (ribeye, 20% ground beef), lots of butter, and most of all heavy whipping cream in a lot of dishes.  Eg, I'll make a low carb milk out of heavy whipping cream.  That and some other fats like cream cheese and what not.  This helped my gallstone get dissolved at a an accelerated rate.  For many people it takes 2 years to dissolve it.\n\n- Every 6-12 months you want to get an ultrasound to see if the stone is dissolved.\n\n- Once the stone is dissolved you need to stay on a high fat diet.  It doesn't have to be incredibly high in fat, just enough to use your gallbladder from time to time, or a new stone will form again.  Likewise, modern studies (anything past the 1990s) show healthy fats are fats lower in omega-6, which is most saturated fat.  If you eat a lot of saturated fat your large LDL will increase, which is the healthy LDL (small dense LDL is the bad LDL).  Your doctor may be unhappy with higher LDL and recommend a statin.  Always get your small LDL checked first before taking a statin.  If you have the healthy kind of LDL a statin can negatively affect your health.\n\nQuestions?"", 'I had my gallbladder out in 2010.

Confusing GC Readings on Libre FreeStyle 2 vs. Finger Stick,"I have been using Libre FreeStyle 2 monitor for some time now but the readings, most of the time, are completely different from my finger stick readings. For example, just this morning, here are a few of the readings to show what I am talking about. (And by the way, I have the stupid ""Dawn Phenomenon"" going on, so my morning readings are always high.)

This morning at **3:02 a.m**., reading with **FStyle2 was 160**. (I always need to go to the bathroom several times a night, so when I am up, I take a reading.)

Then at **5:02 a.m**., the reading was **175**. 

At **6:02 a.m**., reading of **155**. (This reading didn't make any sense to me as my glucose always goes up in the morning until I take my insulin shot.) 

At **6:15 a.m**. it was **190.** 

Because my BG went up 35 points in a matter of 13 minutes**,** I tested with a **finger stick** and it read **164** at **6:18 a.m.**  

I took my insulin shot (20 U of Regular and 18 U of N) and waited for about 45 minutes to test again. 

So, at **7:01 a.m**. the **FStyle2** reading was **164** and the **finger stick** was **184**. ???? I will ask my doctor about this, but I am concerned as to which readings were correct.

Question about meals and tips,"Hi everyone, 

I'd like to share this week's meal and blood sugar log. It's my first week in being consistent and I am hoping to get a clear overall picture. I see a nutritionist in 2 weeks and I am feeling hopeful to make a lifestyle change. I was wondering if I am testing at the right times and any meal suggestions for now?

New diagnosis and a lot to unpack ( AITA diabetic edition),"Forewarning: I‚Äôm in a VERY bad mood.  

 So after generally feeling like crap, constantly tired, ED, being overweight , low libido, blurry vision, and  a family history, I suspected my BF had diabetes.  We had multiple conversations about this for two YEARS.  He refused to go to the Dr so I got a meter finally and tested him myself;
150 fasting. Well! That‚Äôs just great.  I told him he had two options: do something about it or don‚Äôt do anything but I was not sticking around.  I watched a family member kill themselves by diabetes and it‚Äôs a hideous hideous death that was 100% self inflicted.   (By the time they passed they‚Äôd had both feet amputated and were in diapers because they had no control of their bodily functions and were nearly blind and in renal failure. )
He told me he‚Äôd eat what I told him to but he won‚Äôt see a dr and it‚Äôs my responsibility to do all his meal planning and prep and cooking and monitor his numbers. He says he‚Äôs too overwhelmed and depressed and I‚Äôm being selfish if I make him manage his own meals and numbers. 

Is this fair or is this insane? Im not comfortable acting as his dr and I‚Äôm a single mom, I can‚Äôt keep up with 100% of his meal prep. I don‚Äôt have the time.

Alternate with a large salad with lettuce, radish, celery, green pepper, black olive, cucumber, egg.  Variation - add cut ham, turkey and swiss.

Need some advice,"Hello Reddit, I was just recently diagnosed with Diabetes. My A1C was 8.9, naturally seeing this has scared the shit outta me seeing as I'm only 42 with a family I want to see grow.

Remember: always look for constellations of information and share them with your medical professionals. Figure it out. As an example, are you seeing another doctor for HBP or heart health? Tell them about your new diagnosis. Similarly, is there anything that you haven't taken care of but meaning to? Like maybe snoring?

It is also a good idea to see if you can get a referral to an endocrinologist.\n\nI was diagnosed in January 2023 with an A1C of 7.2. I am 47(m) and weighed 320lbs. at the time. It was from a blood test I got when I went ot an urgent care of a different reason. I had been told previously that I was prediabetic, but given no advice on what to do abut it other than eat less and exercise more. I was not provided any information on how serious that was or how easy it is to go frrom prediabetes to diabetes. So I wasted time by not really changing anything.\n\nAfter I was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes, I had a brief 30 minute consultation with a diabetic nurse. She got me testing my blood sugar once a day and told me to follow the ADA dietary guidelines and that my goal for blood sugar was 100 mg\\\\dl. So I started with keep carbs to under 160g per day. My doctor prescribed 1000mg of metformin (500 mg twice a day).\n\nAnd my blood sugars remained high. I did some studying about diabetes and discovered that, at least for me, 160g of carbs a day was sure fire way to keep my diabetes progressing. I started to follow a low carb diet of less than 50g of carbs per day. This was very hard at first because pizza and nachos and rice and beans were all staple parts of my diet. I learned that carbs are not essential, but proteins and fats are. So I leaned into eating more protein and more healthy fats and kept my carbs below 50g per day.\n\nI started to see improvement in my blood sugar numbers. Still higher in the morning (dawn phenomenon) but getting lower. Testing my glucose multiple times a day (first thing in morning, just before a meal, an hour after a meal, and again two hours after a meal) to see what was going on, especially with the foods I was eating.\n\nI found that pretty much any carbs beyond the little in leafy green veggies or in nuts cuased my blood glucose to spike. At this time I advocated to get a CGM prescribed. Once I had that, I will able to track my blood glucose and see exactly what was happening, not just with the foods I ate but also how sleep impacted my number, how stress impacted them and more.\n\nI decide to go for the keto diet and keep my carbs under 20g a day. It took about a week for my carb cravings to go away. I was eating meat, cheese, avocado, leafy greens, and healthy fats like butter, extra virgin olive oil, avocado oil etc, but zero bread, pasta, chips, rice, beans, potatoes, sugar, sugary drinks, juice. And my numbers responded quickly.\n\nSince then, I have decided to a more meat focused keto called ketovore. Most days I am under 5g carbs (strictly from veggies and nuts) and I haven't gone above 20g in probably two months.\n\nI walk 6 days out of 7. I walk after work. (I work a desk job, so not much activity.) I try to keep my heart rate between 110 and 130 (the so called fat burning zone). I walk for at least 30 minutes. If the weather is crappy, I do step exercises in my house for the same 30+ minutes.\n\nI just had my first follow-up A1C post diagnosis. It was 5.6. I have lost 50lbs.

Question about Hba1C and fasting Sugar,"Hello Everyone,

I am T2D since 6 years, I was diagnosed with DKA and A1C of 14. I lost my balance since then.

Hydrochlorothiazide Question,"Hi. My spouse is t2. Diagnosed just this year after a heart attack. He‚Äôs on insulin and metformin. He‚Äôs been doing great on life changes while using treatment. A1C came down to 6 from 10 within 3 months. 

His bp has been going up lately (work has been stressful) so his cardiologist added Amlodipine and Hydrochlorothiazide to his metro er and .5 Losartan he‚Äôs been taking. He started taking these new additions 7 days ago. For the past 3 days he has had a banging headache and his glucose kept spiking really high. It was 283 last night. This cannot be a coincidence because all was fine other than elevated bp lately. His glucose numbers were great prior to this addition. 

Last night he didn‚Äôt take the hydrochlorothiazide because we read online that it can elevate glucose. Today his headache is gone and glucose has came down. 

I talked to the cardio nurse about it and the nurse at his gp. I asked could this be connected and they both say it‚Äôs highly unlikely. They‚Äôve never heard of anyone having glucose spikes from hydrochlorothiazide. So I thought I would ask others if they‚Äôve encountered this before. 

It‚Äôs strange that he was feeling fine (other than elevated bp which he felt no physical effects of) and after starting the bp med additions he‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt. He didn‚Äôt take the hydrochlorothiazide last night and his headache disappeared this morning and his glucose number has come down to almost normal already.

Eyesight,"Hello all! I'm new to this subreddit, having been diagnosed about a week and a half ago with T2 Diabetes. I had gestational diabetes 20 years ago, but this truly feels like an all new ball game. I am currently taking Metformin and Ozempic and doing well with the new diet. Trying to learn SO much about this.

My question is about eyesight and diabetes. I've read that diabetes can give you blurred vision. Well, I've been wearing glasses since I was 16 (35 years ago), so my vision is always blurred and changing. I have progressive lenses, with 3 prescriptions strengths in each lens. Just to give you an idea of what I'm working with.

In the week and a half that I've been on the meds/new diet, my eyes have definitely changed. I can no longer see my computer clearly through the section of lens that I normally do. I put in my contacts last night, and I thought my one contact was a defect because I couldn't see well out of it. But nope, correct lens. And keep in mind I only got these prescriptions maybe 6 months ago or so.

My question is (and I know you are not doctors, but maybe someone has had the same experience), might this be from getting my blood sugar numbers closer to a normal level?

Libre CGM: Very itchy at sensor application site. Tips?,"I recently started using the Libre 2 CGM and so far it's been... not a great experience.

9 Months Post Dx. 4.9 A1C and 50lbs lost,"Just sharing the good news! 

Started at 210 lbs (M) with a 6.9 A1C. Immediately after diagnosis, I declared carbs my enemy and leaned heavy into keto with a caloric deficit to help lose the weight. 

Once the weight began to come off and energy levels returned, my fiance and I started walking, and have been doing so regularly each week. After the walking became easier and the weight started to drop more and more, other exercise did as well. 

I've leaned into weekly HIIT, resistance training, walking the golf course instead of riding, and even the occasional jog! 

I've managed to drop to 159 lbs and a 4.9 A1C! Super happy right now, especially being able to visibly see the results of the work I've put in. 

My challenge now is to drop my high LDL, which I understand is in part from losing so much weight and should be better with stabilization, but I'll be adding more ""better"" fat sources, and more fibre into the diet. I've also kind of moved to low carb where I've allowed myself a bigger variety of vegetables and nuts.

"Type 2 on insulin, highly insulin resistant. A few questions.","I'm in my 40s and have been diabetic for quite a while (been on Metformin for maybe 20 years).

I've progressed through various oral treatments to finally insulin after having a bad case of pneumonia this past winter. I'm waiting on an antibody test to see if the sudden worstening of my blood sugar levels are more to do with lack of insulin production or insulin resistance, and to figure out why it was all of a sudden so much worse.

My internal medecine doctor is pertty open to my suggestions (asked for a c-peptide test but she did the antibody test instead after I suggeted maybe I had an auto-immune incident while ill for example). Insulin was also my idea after strict low carb and monitoring my Dexcom charts daily did not work to bring my blood sugar below 10 mmol/L average range after my bout with pneumonia. I wasn't exericising much then due to recovery.

I titrated my insulin dosage using clinic advice and a CGM, figuing out my carb ratio and correction factor with the help of some youtube videos. Currently taking 60 units basal and roughly 100 units bolus to control my blood sugar eating fairly low carb with the occasional treat like a bun on a burger, berries added to salad, or sometimes a small serving of sweet potato fries with a chicken breast, pork chop, or piece of salmon for example... but typically it's a lower carb green veggie salad as a side.

Taking this much insulin should I be concerned with hyperinsulemia? I'd like to lower my insulin resistance but I have no idea where to start. Is there a test I can get to check the progess that my diet and exercise is making on my insulin resistance or should I not be too concerned because my blood sugar control is now great (5.9-6.2 AGP or projected A1C according to Dexcom.)

Should I get my internal medecine doctor to refer me to an endo? I have so many questions. I'd appreciate any advice on what tests to ask for (not asking for treatment advice like meds or anything like that but what I should ask my doctor? They should provide the decided course of action not me after all).

Thank you all for this great community btw, I've alrady learned so much since joining the sub, along with the diabetes sub.

The antibody test was a good start, but a good endocrinologist will cover all the bases and find out why your condition has suddenly changed. As for the insulin, speaking from personal experience, you can still lower your insulin resistance while taking insulin. My A1C was a whopping 16.2 at diagnosis, so I needed to take insulin (long-acting), for several months until that figure came down and I could wean myself off of it. Also, there are much better drugs than metformin. I didn‚Äôt tolerate it well, but also it didn‚Äôt do a thing for me anyway, so I was put on Mounjaro first, and now take Ozempic. The GLP-1 antagonists have worked wonders. I‚Äôm off insulin now and my A1C is 5.6', ""I'd definitely seek an Endo. They are specialized to handle diabetes."", 'I was on glipside, metformin and insulin and my numbers were going up. I switched to a glp-1 and have had amazing results. Just something to bring up.', ""Agreed. \nI have had great sucess in managing my diabetes and have reduced my insulin to only some long acting. I am very insulin resistant. \n\nMy doc told me last month that mounjaro was being discussed in the diabetic field as a first line t2 diabetes med even before metformin!! I assume he meant all the meds in this class but he called out mounjaro. \n    \nSeeing an endo would be Op's best course as they will know about several potential meds that will help your situation. They may still want insulin as well in the beginning but that can be reduced or eliminated once you have contol and stable internal processes."", ""Thank-you for the insights. I will ask for a referral from her... I'm in Canada so I'm not sure if there will be a waiting list. I already mentioned Ozempic and she agrees, but wants to wait until the antibody test comes back first, something about it not being approved for Type 1 or LADA is it (the autoimmume adult version of Type 1). Mounjaro is approved in Canada but not yet available... it's my understanding that it adds a 2nd agonist along with the one for GLP-1 and is more effective (higher weight loss anyways in studies I do recall). Once I get my antibody test back I will have another appointment with her for the referral and to be put on Ozempic and possibly back on Metformin. She mentioned last time my lactic actid levels were up which is why I was taken off of it."", 'I‚Äôm glad to hear that. Mounjaro worked amazingly on me, but it‚Äôs so relatively new on the market that my insurance does not have it on their formulary, or at least without the preauthorization requirement. Given the price tag, the only reason I‚Äôve been able to use it here and there is due to free samples and coupons given to me by my endo. When I don‚Äôt have a supply, I take Ozempic, which is okay, but compared to the control I get with Mounjaro, Ozempic kind of feels like a value brand. Lol!\n\nI hear that Mounjaro targets a broader class of receptors than only the GLP-1 receptors that other similar medications do, which is why it is more effective. My endo even said something interesting last time I was in her office. She used the word ‚Äúreversal‚Äù when talking about it. That piqued my interest and I asked if she meant ‚Äúremission‚Äù, but she actually meant reversal and said the medical community isn‚Äôt very certain about it yet and is still collecting data, but it looks possible, even likely, that type 2 diabetes can be reversed in some people with this drug and others like it.\n\nI personally believe if this class of drugs becomes the first line of treatment for type 2 over Metformin, it‚Äôll present a sea change in how this disease is managed, and given all the sad stories I‚Äôve heard of people struggling so hard for control with the more traditional approaches, it‚Äôll be a much needed change.', 'Sure thing. Yes, Mounjaro definitely is the better drug for weight loss in my experience. I wasn‚Äôt even at an unhealthy weight, but managed to drop 25 lbs in the first 2 months I was taking it- enough to return my waistline to what it was in my 20‚Äôs. If it weren‚Äôt for my recent discovery of low carb ice cream then I might even have a fair chance at getting back my six pack! Lol!\n\nAnyway, the weight loss was an added bonus, but the amount of control I‚Äôm able to get on the drug is astonishing. Whenever I start taking Mounjaro, my sugars consistently stay within a range of about 85-110 mg/dl. I certainly hope for you all that it becomes available in Canada soon because it really is that good.\n\nOzempic is pretty good too. At least I maintain the lower weight when I am taking it, but the amount of control is somewhat less. I tend to average about 115 mg/dl while on it and that isn‚Äôt too shabby. I do have to stay more careful about my diet though because I have greater spikes when I am on Ozempic, but generally no higher than 150 mg/dl which isn‚Äôt too bad.\n\nStill, if I had my pick, I‚Äôd stick with Mounjaro. Regrettably though, my insurance refuses to cover it, so I‚Äôm only able to take the drug right now whenever my endocrinologist gives me some of the free samples they provide her.', ""We will be hearing much more about this type and the new ones in the treatment of diabetes. They are life changing for us diabetics.  I have difficulty with the idea of remission. Because it isn't a cure. It's like stopping blood pressure meds and the BP goes back up.

My doc put me on low dose ozempic mainly for the protective factors. 6 weeks on starter dose and the side effects got worse. Nausea and abdominal pain. I stopped it. Is there any comparable med that doesn‚Äôt have the sides that y‚Äôall know of? I‚Äôm suspecting they all do it but looking for others‚Äô experiences.', 'That‚Äôs unfortunate. I didn‚Äôt have side effects like that, but I can see how a person might. For me, Mounjaro is a powerful appetite suppressant, so I imagine that I might have similar side effects if I took a larger dose than prescribed. Perhaps ask your doctor if it‚Äôs worth trying an even lower dose of Ozempic? Both drugs have a similar mode of action, so it could be that you‚Äôre more sensitive to a higher dose of Ozempic like I am to a higher dose of Mounjaro.\n\nOtherwise, there are a whole bunch of alternatives in this class of drugs. I only know that because I tried to argue with my insurance about covering Mounjaro when I couldn‚Äôt get Ozempic due to shortages. They suggested a whole list of alternatives (but still refused to cover Mounjaro üôÑ).', 'There is a daily oral version of the same GLP-1 agonist called Rybelsus that may work better for you.

A1C Update,"90 days ago my A1C was 9.4 and my doctor wanted to increase my metformin and add another medication.

90 days later of diligent keto/low carb, my A1C is 5.7.

I did have a few cheat meals. Maybe 3 or 4, but even those 'cheats' were things like fajitas at a restaurant with my keto tortillas. A small order of chips and queso, but only ate like 6 chips, the rest I put on my tacos(Torchy's) in a bowl.

Fear.  I noticed my vision kept going in and out of focus.  That really scared me.\n2. My Dr. prescribed Metformin and Wellbutrin.

When they are successful with that, we take it one more step.\n\nHumans are the same way. If we bite off too much and can't hit the goal, we feel like we failed. We have less motivation to try again because the whole thing is associated with negative feelings.\n\nDo what the dogs do. Go back and set a goal that is just the tiniest step in the right direction. Stick with that for a week. The object here is to be successful at something, however small, and give yourself a gold star and a pat on the back.

IR- I'm down in the dumps,"Hey everyone,

This may sound somewhat stupid, but I feel so massively duscouraged from life since I got the diagnosis ""pre-diabetic/insulin-resistent"".

It just feels like I get punished for what little pleasures I have. I work a Ton, Studi on the side, i'm about to move, take care of my mother and help my sisters who both have a lot going on in their lives. 

It's stressful but I was far from unhappy -actually the opposite. Things were going quite well, a lot better than in the past.

Anyway, I realized that some things were off with my body and had the vague idea it might  be my blood sugar and yep, Iwas Spot on. Currently having around 110 mg/dl fasting sugar on average. 

I'm 32, overweight and the way I eat Was generally good (lots of wholegrain, verggies,  lean meat, good oil and  fat fish). BUT: Due to my job I eat very irregularly and often substitute meals with sugary energy drinks to keep up. I also eat way too much chocolate as a reward (no crisps, other Soda, cookies, etc). I'm normally also too tired for sports. 

My Doc was basically mad at me with little understanding and blamed me a lot for not taking better care of myself. She told me to immediately quit the Energy drink/sweet drinks generally and chocolate max once/week. Diet variations with sweeteners other than sugar are also rubbish as they indirectly worsen glucose absorption so I'm not allowed Diet Coke to at least somewhat Soften the blow from quitting energy drinks (i had about 1,5l/day of it).

I changed everything the way she instructed me to and I feel crappy. Not necessarily physically, but mentally definitely. Food is no fun. I know how to cook and I like what I eat, but its still no fun. In the world we live in, it feels like 85% is a no for me while everyone else digs in. It feels like enjoying is forbidden, theres always the worry if it's too much, is it going to spike my levels too much..
It's hot as heck and people enjoy ice-cream, cold drinks/Juice, etc and I sit here with my water. Had spinach and fish for dinner and that's it, tomorrow another 12 hour shift and there is that. 

Don't laugh at me but I'm starting to feel depressed.  Doc says I must be very consequent or diabetis type2 will be my ( rather soon) future which I absolutely want to avoid.

I know I have to Lose weight and be more active but instead of comfort, food has just become another worry in my life that I didnt need, I have enough.

And yes, I eat Fruit, but it gives me nothing taste wise.  I also don't like fats and replacing  carbs with a degree of fat is difficult, full-fat milk, yoghurt and meat taste aweful imho.

This ended up to be a vent, but nevertheless I'd like to ask how you dealt with this situation?

After a lot of reflection on myself I now understand that my reasons for not doing it were nothing other than excuses. Aim for 2 x 10 min walks per day and you'll see a change.\n* Resistance training, I keep a set of dumbbells next to my desk and use them in meetings. I'm still fat but my arms look great.\n* Milk is high in sugar and carbs whether it's full fat or not so go for 2% and just go easy on it. Fairlife milk is 50% lower in both.\n* There is keto chocolate and ice cream, sure it isnt as nice but less amputations down the road if you eat those instead.\n* The only thing I truly miss is bread, pasta, and french fries. I do eat keto bread but minimal as it is still spikey on the blood sugar. I also eat french fries once in a while, maybe twice per month but usually only when my BG is under 100 and I keep the rest of the meal low carb.\n\nIf you're treating food as comfort them I highly recommend you get some counseling. It was for me too and it shouldn't be. I still treat myself to some things but it's a once a week once per month thing, not daily, and I typically wait for low blood sugar before I do e.g. If I'm around 80ish then I might make myself a latt√© without guilt.\n\nBottom line is I have sympathy for you but only so much.

Question about exercise and BG levels (learning still),"Hello all,

So, my sugars have been a bit resistant lately and after a meal of 40 carbs (strawberries, two eggs, some whole wheat crackers) my sugar skyrocketed to 200 within 45 minutes. Decided to do my dance/low impact HIIT workout videos for about 35 minutes starting at 11:20am.

Within 10 minutes of post-workout, I went down to 156-159. Happy to see that considering it wasn't 2 hours yet post-meal. But now I just checked and it's 162. Why did it go up some? Will it go back down and lower?

Trying to get to 140 or lower before next meal. Bit confused.

Any way to make testing with lancets nicer or easier?,"I've recently started using a glucose monitor after being diagnosed with T2D a few months ago and am already sick to death of the lancet poking. My doctor recommended just testing fasting sugar once a day or maybe even only a few times a week, but more and more I'm realizing that's probably not enough to really know how different foods affect me.

But I am too chicken and wimpy to test multiple times a day every day. Even just doing one or two tests a day at most, and skipping a day here or there, it is hard to keep track of which finger I used last. I'm afraid all my fingers are going to turn into a calloused mess. Sometimes it hurts, sometimes not. I'm having to adjust the depth of the lancet depending on the finger, too. There are already little poke marks on all the fingers I've used.

Marriage issues?,"This is probably way more than a diabetes related post, but did the diagnosis affect your marriage?

He said, ""afterwards we can go eat."" My thinking is, ""afterwards we can walk around downtown. "" Yes, that might include lunch but I can no longer use food as entertainment. If we eat lunch, I want to walk but he will say it's too hot. Or whatever so he'll want to eat and then get back in the car and drive home 2 hours.

He's supportive but it's just me on my own doing it, which is fine but if I'm going to be doing it on my own, I want to do it all on my own, if that makes sense. Not have to worry about if I'm leaving him alone to exercise or planning a meal he will also like. Things like that.

If all else fails, maybe consider some marriage counseling? \n\nNo matter what you choose, I certainly hope you two work it out. Much love to you today.', 'There is a lot there building up. Something has got to start relieving the pressure, or it\'s going to erupt like the San Andreas Fault.\n\n**My first suggestion is to step out of the framework that** ***he*** **is the problem**, and if he would only do X, Y, and Z everything would be fine.\n\nFirst of all because he is a person with his own wants, needs, and preferences which are just as valid as yours.\n\nAnd second, because that framework *turns you into a victim*. You are just a leaf flowing downstream with no agency. That thinking blocks you up. If *he* is the problem then all you can do is sit there and wait for him to change. And that leaves you frustrated and helpless. And it can lead to depression and losing hope.\n\nSo, all of this goes in the trash: blaming him, finding fault with his choices, expecting him to change, trying to argue him into submission. He no longer has to change. You do.  Not because this is your ""fault"". We are removing blame and fault finding from the equation.\n\n**In it\'s place we bring in a new priority:** ***possibility***. How we got here isn\'t as crucial as what we can do to get through and to the other side. I know this might sound airy-fairy. But how you frame this really is your choice. It can be the story of how everything external is blocking you and you are powerless to overcome it. Or, it can be a story of using the intelligence, compassion, and creativity inside you to open a door that previously wasn\'t there.\n\nThe first step is to just talk. This is a conversation where nothing else is going on. You have each other\'s full attention.\n\n**Tell him what you are** ***feeling***. No one can argue with you feel - you are the world\'s foremost expert on that topic. This is just about your experience. Don\'t blame him, don\'t tell him what he did wrong, don\'t give him a list of things he needs to do differently. Solutions can come later. Right now you just want to give him the world through your eyes.\n\nOnce you have laid it out, **ask him to repeat back in his own words what he has heard**. This is crucial. We can easily get into a rhythm where we are only half listening because in our mind we are preparing our own arguments. No, you each have to listen and then tell what you have just understood the other person to say. Being heard is maybe the most important part of the process. How much of a burden would that lift just knowing that he *gets it*. He understands what you are going through. If he misses something come back to that, and then have him tell you what he now knows.\n\n**Now reverse the process. Ask him what he is feeling**. How has this time been for him? Is he angry about something? Does he resent the new regimen you have to stick to? Does he miss the carefree person who used to go do fun things with him? Listen carefully. And, again, pay particular attention to how he *feels*. Feelings are more important than events or circumstances. Make a note because you will want to come back and try and address these things.\n\nBut first, when he is done, it is your turn to give the feedback. Tell him what you have just heard him say. Let *him* know that he has been heard.\n\nEven if you were to just stop here, you are so much farther along than you were before. You can each see what each other is struggling with. You now have both your and his points of view.\n\nCarrying on. **If he brought up things that you did or said that hurt him, ask his forgiveness** for both what you did, and the pain you caused. Intention doesn\'t really matter here - you probably weren\'t trying to cause him pain. But, it happened. And hurt is hurt regardless of the other party\'s intention. And if it is unresolved, then it will remain a road block. This is just standard relationship repair. Apologies and forgiveness are the oil that keeps marriages going. Otherwise you would just build up a list of resentments until you explode.\n\nHe may see a way that he hurt you and might want to apologize. Some people know how to take responsibility for damage they have done, and others don\'t.

Everyone takes time to adjust and learn their way around this new world.\n\nThe good news is that, unlike many other disease diagnosis, you can actually do something about this. Stopping the effects (and in some cases reversing the damage) is very possible.\n\n*The Diabetes Code* by Dr. Jason Fung and Nina Teicholz is a classic book on the subject. It explains what diabetes is and how it works, and then what you can do to stop the damage, and actually become healthier than you have ever been in your life.\n\n**My 1-2-3 Diet Changes**\n\nHere are three easy to remember steps to get you new life off the ground.\n\n**1. Eliminate:**\n\n* Sugar\n* White Flour (bread, pasta)\n* Potatoes\n* White Rice\n\nThese are the biggies. If you do only this, you are 60% there. *Don‚Äôt go cold turkey* \\- do it in steps. Cut the portions in half the first week, then half again the following. You don't want to take away the joy you currently have in eating. And even when you are going full speed ahead, it's OK to have a couple of your friend's french fries or a bite of birthday cake. (Not at the same time.) You will still get to taste your favorites, but you will have new favorites for your nourishment.\n\n**2. Eat only small controlled portions of complex carbs:**\n\n* Oatmeal\n* Brown rice\n* Sweet potatoes and squash\n* Beans\n\nThe difference between this list and the first one is that these actually deliver important fiber and nutrients, rather than just empty calories. However, they are carbs so you have to go easy and watch your tests during the day to see how your body handles them.\n\n**3. Replace the missing space on your plate with vegetables**\n\nCooked vegetables, frozen vegetables, salads - there is no reason to be hungry, just swap the empty carbs out and these in. Keep your meat/protein portion the same as before. Resist the temptation to double up on the meat to replace the missing potatoes and bread.\n\nThat‚Äôs the starting point. Do this, add some exercise,  and you are on your way to health again. You can then fine tune with your glucose meter readings to match your specific metabolism.\n\nI have another great book recommendation. *Diabetes Cookbook and Meal Plan for the Newly Diagnosed* by Lori Zanini. It assumes you are overwhelmed, and explains what is going on and what needs to change. Then it gives you a four week plan for easing into this new world. It helped me a lot."", 'I use a lot spices and cook a lot of ethnic foods, so that‚Äôs an easy thing to take over thankfully.

Tons of useful information online and in this subreddit. My best advice, start reading labels. Look for carb count not sugar count. Things you thought were healthy might not be healthy for you anymore and vice versa. \n\nI can\'t even begin to tell you the importance of ""pairing"" your food. Try eating in this order: clean protein/healthy fat (chicken/fish/avocado/eggs), veggies (avoid root veggies), small amounts of healthy carbs. Protein slows down digestion (and keeps you full) but veggies keep things moving. When you eat stuff like fruit, opt for things like apples and berries. They have a low glycemic impact while bananas and juice will send your glucose skyrocketing. Lots of water. LOTS!\n\nThings I have to completely avoid are regular bread, rice, dried fruit, potatoes, sweet drinks, junk food, cereal, bananas, etc. Snack ideas: low sugar jerky, tuna pouches, nuts, cheese, whisps, pickles, olives.\n\nFor me personally, I wasn\'t eating a ton of junk food, I was eating way too much fruit. Get your portions under control and you will find not only do your numbers look better but you will feel better.\n\nYou can totally do this. It\'s a bit of a roller coaster at first but you will find your way. In the mean time, feel free to vent and ask questions. It\'s so much easier when you realize you aren\'t alone.

The most eye-opening thing was finding out that dietary fat and cholesterol don‚Äôt affect your bloodwork numbers like triglycerides and cholesterol but carbs do.\n\nOne thing about cutting carbs is making up the calories elsewhere. Lean meat probably won‚Äôt be as satiating as it was. You‚Äôll need to increase your fat intake to pick up the energy that carbs were providing. But it‚Äôs ok. You‚Äôll burn it off if you maintain some moderation.', 'Ok, the advice here is all over the place.  Start walking 30 minutes every single day.

If you think about starchy vegetables, they tend to be low-fat.  If you think about fatty fruits (e.g. avocados) or meat, they tend to be low-carb.  The major exception to this would be milk, which contains both and exists to help infants grow quickly (bulk up).\n\nMost other mammals don\'t naturally eat ""meals"" or processed foods (in which we tend to mix carbs and fats together in our stomachs at the same time).   When we eat such combinations we tend to gain or maintain weight.

The Randle cycle (which I linked above) is a proposed mechanism for why low-carb or low-fat could help improve blood sugar clearance.', ""It seems there are two ways proven to work.

You don't need to eat like a rabbit, put some olive oil in those green beans, or some cheese on that broccoli. full fat dressing is your friend.\n\n\n+ _full fat greek yogurt instead of the sugary Yoplait stuff._  They also make pretty good artificially sweetened yogurt, but believe me, you will have more success cutting sweet flavors drastically for now, before incorporating small amounts again.\n\n\n+ _cauliflower rice instead of white rice for your casseroles and sides._  You can buy it in ready-made microwavable steam bags now.  I don't think it works great for stir-fry or fried rice, but just about every other flavored application, it's legitimately enjoyable.  Bonus tip - if you're a cheese grits gal, hit it with a food processor and throw cream cheese, some cheddar, and some butter or cream and you will get very close. \n\n+ _rice and pasta_ :OK, so you might have noticed, but these are the hardest things to sub out or eliminate.  For some of us, its an entire cultural culinary history seemingly in the garbage. You're right to be concerned about what to do.  If you can't remove them or sub them for non-grain products like **cauli rice or veggie spirals/konjac**, you can use _basmati rice and chickpea/high protein pasta._  As others have said, **these are still carbs**, so portion control is essential.  Use a scale or known pre-portioned amounts, but you'll also be surprised how 2/3 cup cooked rice or 2 oz uncooked pasta is plenty alongside your sauces, meats, veggies.  \n\n\n+ _daves killer bread or ezekiel bread, carb-counter tortillas and josephs flax pita breads._  These are all low carb alternatives to full carb typical bread products.  You may prefer to cut them entirely - after all, many of us stop eating pastries, cakes, donuts etc, so it can be done with bread too - but if you can't quite put up with no way to eat sandwiches, tacos, wraps 'normally', these are all good ways to reduce total carbs and glycemic load vs typical. Just pay close attention to serving sizes on those. \n\n\n**I hated hearing it, so I hate repeating it to others, but its the truth: diabetes and pre-diabetes cases are highly individualized.**  Your needs, tolerances, and specific obstacles *will not be identical* to someone else's.  However, some broad trends as pointed out by others:\n\n\n+ Several major studies show drastic improvement when prompt action is taken to significantly reduce carbs and, if possible/warranted, weight as well. You will see a lot of overlap with Keto diets in the advice pool, and that's why.  **Your limits may vary, but the golden rule is - the fewer carbs, especially readily-absorbed carbs like wheat, sugars (including lactose and fructose), and potato starches - the easier it will be for you to bring down your blood glucose levels and keep them down.**  The same studies also show that bringing down your A1C quickly along with weight loss (if applicable) significantly reduces the chance of progressing to diabetes or suffering complications from diabetes.  \n\n\n\n+ Light exercise soon after a meal can reduce the glucose spike duration and intensity. \n\n\n+ if you have carbs on the plate, push them to the last part of your meal.  You shouldn't be eating carbs on their own, pair them with protein always. \n\n\n\nLast bit of good news, its never been easier to track your exact intake.  I use MacroFactor, but many use MyFitnessPal or other programs.  They have huge databases of food and recipe calculators too.  Get a cheap food scale, and be honest with your tracking method, and in a few weeks you'll know what your given carbohydrate and/or protein goal looks like.  You'll be surprised how high carb the average diet is, and how much you can cut out without even really missing it. \n\n\nThat said, you WILL miss something, and you will feel weird or bad or angry. These first weeks are the hard part, but remember - **it's not a moral failing that got you here.**  You don't have to feel bad- your body doesn't work like other people's (and only time will tell on the particulars of your needs), and your mission is to find a new way of doing things that DOES work for you. In that way it's no different from an allergy.\n\n\n It may be that you will have to make more changes, or take medication, even though you're doing everything 'right'.  **It's also entirely possible that, in the long run, not much will change, and I hope that's how it goes!** But this is why its important not to moralize the diagnosis - changes to diet and exercise are a form of *treatment*, not simply 'clean, simple living' or whatever, and if they aren't enough, that won't be your fault either.  **Do the best you can**, get qualified advice from medical professionals, and keep an open mind - your first attempt at 'lifestyle changes' may not work like you hope, so you have to be willing to try again.   It's always worth trying again, even if you have to show up here from time to time to vent first.  ***You can do it.***"", 'I‚Äôm honestly not sure.

The honeymoon has been over...,"... and I'm struggling to get back.

When I was diagnosed almost 2 years ago I was very inspired, became super strict and brought down my A1c within two A1C results. But I couldn't hold that strictness because I was too strict so I let go a little bit but my numbers didn't change that much. I however was careful not go over the top. Then my numbers went to the normal levels and after a few A1cs the doctor allowed me to go off metformin.

Last December I just let go completely, but avoided my trigger foods. I stopped exercising, stopped working on my stress, stopped drinking enough water, stopped eating enough fiber. And my A1C has been rising with every A1c. 

For some reason yesterday I was inspired to really become careful again. Meaning just start on my lifestyle changes. 

So all I did was just start drinking water. I even bought myself a new 64 oz water jug, and I started drinking. I drank as much as I would usually do when I was diagnosed. Just that surprised me this morning my usual morning sugars dropped significantly.  I had cheated yesterday and had a slice of bread and small part of a chocolate birthday cake.

Yesterday, I tried a few spoonfuls of a keto hazelnut spread I found on Amazon.  Big mistake!  My blood sugar spiked to 210!  I immediately drank a bunch of water and went on a 30 minute walk.  Here's the weird part: one hour after the 210 reading, I did another finger prick, the result? 68!

I thought it was a mistake, so I replaced the batteries in my meter, changed to a new pack of strips and tested again...same result.  I've NEVER dropped this low.  Luckily, 2 hours later, everything went back to normal.  

Has anyone else experienced such a dramatic swing?  Should I be concerned?

Holy Hell! Stay away from Monster Energy Drinks,"Occasionally before I go to the gym at the end of the day, I'll pick up a can of diet Red Bull for a little extra pep.

Different Spikes for Different Folks,"I know several diabetics and it's always amazes me that despite diabetics usually are supposed to be on a low carb diet, different carbs will have different effects on different people.  


For example, my mom who's T2D diabetic will vary rarely have rice (even basmati rice), mango, watermelon, and bananas, because it makes her blood glucose go up. Meanwhile, she will eat yogurt and ice cream (not the low sugar kind) with no problem. Sometimes going for 2nds and 3rds.  My father when he was alive, also a T2D, he could eat rice, fried foods, and ice cream with no problem, like a decent amount.  But bread, soda, juice, bananas, candy would make his blood sugar go up.  My stepmother, also a T2D, there are do many things she can't eat, even the stuff that's low carb/low sugar.  A former coworker who is T2D, he could Ramen noodles or any Asian noodles with no problem, but candy, soda, coffee, juice, and potatoes, couldn't eat. 


Then I see people who I would believe there are diabetics because they seem to eat everything a regular non-diabetic does and in large amounts, but they say their blood glucose is always in the safe levels.  Then people like my stepmother, it seems everything makes her blood sugar go up, even the things that are supposed safe.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/14heux8/different_spikes_for_different_folks/,"['I‚Äôm a recently diagnosed Type 2.

Testing new food,"So, I tested a new food today, and my meal was still balanced, but I was wondering if, from y'alls experience,  if your BG is a certain number 30 mins after, then lower 1 hr after, that the spike is over? For reference,  I tested 30 mins after eating and my BG was 87, then 1 hr after it was 83. Will it continue to lower or is there  a possibility that it will spike again at the 2hr or 3 hr mark? 
Note: I am on 5mg of Mounjaro and now have an average BG of 87 over 7 days with my highest spike being 94.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/14hglkd/testing_new_food/,"['Depends on the type of meal.  Mixed macros (e.g. carbs + fat) tend to reduce maximum blood sugar, delay the spike, and spread it out over a longer period of time.

Also, other external factors like exercise, stress, hydration, etc could be at play.']"
Could I really just have one really high carb meal a day and walk two hours afterwards?,"Hi all.  I'm diagnosed type 2.  I recently got a CGM from a relative and it has been very interesting.  It seems with the worst meals (especially juice and soda)  I spike to about 320ish about 2 hours post meal.  Fasting I am usually around 115-130ish.

I recently did an experiment and had a Deluxe combo meal from Taco Bell (1 cheesy Gordita crunch, two taco supremes, 1 chips and nachos -- needless to say MASSIVE carbs) as well as a DIET Mt. Dew.  I then walked pretty vigorously immediately afterwards for 1.5 hours.  To my utter shock I noticed that during this time my glucose never went above 150 and was still within the green range on the Libre app!

I did notice that upon slowing my pace and definitely when stopping the glucose started to shoot up a bit and eventually to 240ish.  Now during this time I kind of messed up and didn't properly hydrate with water (I know now to fix this).    I am also on Farxiga (which dumps glucose out in your urine as a means of reducing glucose in the body).  So I suspect if I properly hydrated myself the effect would have even been better.  I also quit after 1.5 hours but I could have easily done another 30 minutes and probably not had any real spike at all.

But my question to you wiser and more experienced people, is this really a viable strategy?  To just have one horrible meal a day and then literally walk it off for the next two hours?  If I really keep my glucose under say 160 the entire time does this really mean I managed to totally negate any negative effect on my diabetes due to such a meal?  Or are there other long term things happening too?  Note: I know such a meal obviously isn't healthy overall.  I'm just speaking in regards to diabetes here and the exercise as a way to negate the glucose spike from one of these meals every once in a while!",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/14hgjck/could_i_really_just_have_one_really_high_carb/,"[""no, that is not a good strategy in the slightest. sure it is better than still being at 320 after 2 hours, which is really high. but that doesn't mean climbing to 240 after 1.5 hrs is a good sign. that's a bad sign.\n\ndon't bandaid bad choices if you want to live a long, complication free life. if you keep doing that, your disease will get worse, and you will no longer be able to even accomplish what you did here. \n\nmore medications, feeling worse, more medications, losing a leg, going blind, and early death. that's what we are fighting against here. \n\nis food that gives you 10 minutes of dopamine worth that to you? you'll have to decide."", ""High carb?

The itch starts out mild, then feels also sharp like when you touch pink insulation. Then the area that itches spreads. It drives me insane! I ended up carrying a tube of cortisone cream with me, and use an ice pack if I‚Äôm near one.

Weirdly, the issue I have is what seems like excessive dry skin on only the left side of my body on my trunk, inner-thigh, and on the upper-back of my left and shoulder.

How did you manage getting off or reducing medication,"I‚Äôm thinking about reducing the amount of medicine I take and I‚Äôll def consult my doctor about this next visit.

Two hypos in two days,"Hi all.

Not newly diagnosed per se, but newly taking medication. After 3 years of ignoring the diagnosis I am now under GP care and managing things with medication and blood glucose monitoring. 

Week one was 500mg metaformin and 40Mg Gliclazide after breakfast and evening meal.
Week two 500mg metaformin and 80mg Gliclazide after breakfast and 1000mg Metaformin and 80mg Gliclazide after evening meal.

I had a review Tuesday and was asked to take 1000mg Metaformin after breakfast  and I have a prescription for Dapagliflozen that I will start when it is delivered.

So on Wednesday about 10 am I was so tired I had to go back to bed . I set an alarm for 11 am as this was when I was due to take post breakfast blood glucose test as well as the fact I am working from home so really I could only be absent for an hour. I slept right through the 11 am alarm. I have never slept through an alarm in my life. Never. I woke up about 13:30 and got straight back to laptop and started working. I wasn‚Äôt hungry so I was not bothered about lunch just yet, but I just had an inkling something was wrong based on how exhausted I felt and the fact I slept through the alarm. Did my bloods and it was 3.8.
So I was told anything under 4.0 is a hypo. I drank some icing sugar dissolved in water and took again and it was 5.1. Ate two rich teas and got it to 5.8 which is well out hypo range. By 4pm I had to go back to bed as I was exhausted. No further lows that day.

Today same thing happened . So exhausted I had to go to bed, woke up at 13:00 and took bloods and it was 2.8, which again is hypo. Drank icing sugar water and ate lunch  half  an hour which took me up to 12 one hour after eating and I‚Äôm just waiting for the two hours to be up to see what it is doing now. I think I need to stop taking the extra 500mg at breakfast . The diabetic nurse is calling me on Tuesday so I can explain to her then that this has been happening.

I‚Äôm also desperate to go back to bed. In three weeks I have gone from lunch time bloods being 10-13s to the lowest of 2.8. 
 I thought being T2 meant I couldn‚Äôt get hypos?????",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/14gzcq5/two_hypos_in_two_days/,"['The glicazide is a Sulfonylurea (aka an insulin pusher).

Changes - 
No diabetes medication; omega 3 & B complex supplements; initial lifestyle changes were dramatic with (almost) a ketogenic diet for 2+ months later switched to whole grains and clean food (1300-1500 cals per day); simple changes such as eat fiber and fat before any carbs; moderate exercise 4-5 times a week (mostly it‚Äôs something simple like a brisk walk after dinner and I‚Äôve only recently started strength training again).

Basically, he says that if we never fast, we never really deplete the glycogen stores in the liver. By fasting, you are allowing the liver to unload some stored fuel but it takes time. Fasting makes a lot more sense when you look at it from the hunter/gatherer days where feast and famine were a part of daily life. We have never had a stable food supply as a species until very recently.\n\nI‚Äôve also read some overinflated balloon analogy where the liver goes crazy dumping glucose as you prepare to wake up because it‚Äôs jam packed with stored energy.

A1C at 5.2% after stopping metformin,"

Hi everyone. Wanted to share some good news. 

I (31M) posted on world diabetes day last year when I got diagnosed with T2 with an A1C of 8.3%. I was 310lbs and 6'4"". Started taking 1000mg metformin once a day. I stopped taking it once I got to 5% 3 months back. I was really nervous that my numbers would be back up because of that and I also had a bad month or so where I splurged more than I should have. Thankfully my latest A1C is 5.2%. Here is my journey: 

Nov 14th, 2022 - 8.3%
Dec 23rd, 2022 - 6.6%
Feb 2nd, 2023 - 5.4% 
(reduced metformin to 500mg)
Mar 23rd, 2023 - 5% 
(Stopped metformin altogether)
Jun 21st, 2023 - 5.2%

I cannot insist how important a CGM was for me to keep my levels in check. There were weeks in the middle where I didn't have it on and I noticed I always eat more unhealthy stuff when I don't know my glucose levels. 

Secondly this sub helped a lot. Will continue the good fight along with you all. Thank you. 

Thirdly, I have been stuck on 285 lbs for a while now and my weight loss definitely slowed down without metformin. I was a little more determined back then so I am sure it wasn't the only factor but the pace of weight loss was really nice with metformin.

It‚Äôs okay if you have have a cheat meal or even a bad day but its important to get back on track. This for the rest of our life so we have to treat it like a marathon.']"
Relationship between A1C and steroids,"So, I know that steroids can raise ones A1C ... but is this actually raising your blood sugar in your body, or distorting the results.

Worried sick about my mother,"Hello, so I‚Äôd like to start by saying this is mostly me venting, but I‚Äôm open to support and suggestions. 

My (25f) mother (59f) was hospitalized last week for high EVERYTHING. Blood sugar, blood pressure, cholesterol, you name it. Her A1C was 13+. They brought her levels down in the hospital, sent her home, and increased her insulin dosage.

Today, I tried to call her and she wouldn‚Äôt answer two calls an hour apart. I live an hour away but I was about to drive to her when she called and said my cousin called the ambulance for her because she took the insulin on an empty stomach and then went to sleep and woke up with a blood sugar of around 40. She‚Äôs kind of scatterbrained in that way (I‚Äôve always wondered if she had undiagnosed ADHD, but she doesn‚Äôt really believe in that).

She‚Äôs been a diabetic for almost my entire life. I don‚Äôt know how I can help her or what I can do. I‚Äôve been preaching about taking care of herself for years and there‚Äôs always an excuse.

6.2 A1C,Monday I had Lab work done for the first time since moving back to Texas in Feb. My A1C was 6.2 the last time I had it done was Sept last year in NY and I was off my metformin for 2 months and was having to do OTC insulin for 6 weeks and couldn't afford to do it every meal. The Dr told me that 6.2 was to high. But I thought it was pre diabetic and my A1C has only came up a few points since it was 5.9 in September.

7.6 to 5.4 in four months,"Diagnosed in February (after years of avoiding the doctor, so probably undiagnosed for at least a couple years). Thought my life was over. Immediately changed my diet and started exercising more, in addition to going on a low dosage of Metformin ER and a statin (high cholesterol, too, yay). 

Just had my A1C checked again and I‚Äôm in‚Ä¶ ‚Äúnormal‚Äù range?! I‚Äôm so happy I could cry. I‚Äôve lost 43 pounds, my lifestyle is pretty different, and all other test results are good too (except high platelet count‚Äîcan anyone tell me what this means lol).

What works for me may not work for everyone but here‚Äôs what I do: Calorie deficit, limit carbs to 150g a day (started with 100g, but I allowed myself to go up once I stabilized), intermittent fasting (16-8), try to go for more whole foods (and I‚Äôve been vegetarian for years), walk at least 8k steps a day, often much more, paired with exercise (stationary bike, strength training, and workouts). I‚Äôm not so good at keeping the stress down and regular sleep schedule, but trying.

I went in for my 6 month checkup today expecting the worst...,"And instead I had my lowest A1C reading ever - 5.0. 

I was diagnosed with an A1C of 13.7 in December 2021. 2022 was a bit of a rollercoaster as we tried different meds, and I tried various things like exercise and diet and low carb and restricted calorie and I was generally just miserable and depressed. My readings were around 7, then up to 10, then down to 6, and then today I hit 5. 

Thing is, I don't feel like I earned this at all. I eat less than I used to. I've lost 50 lbs and I'm still losing. But my diet is pretty poor. Fast food a few times a week which includes fries and breaded chicken. A small bowl of soup for lunch usually, which has probably 20-30 carbs in it. I've had cookies. I just took a week off work to binge a new game and I was the worst diabetic you can imagine during that week. I ate things like Doritos, a sub from a sub shop, a casserole filled with carbs, etc. I'm eating like half of what I used to because the meds I'm on cut my appetite down, but still... the quality of what I'm eating...

I'm just in shock. How can I be this low? Don't get me wrong - I'm ecstatic. My eye doc was super happy with my progress as well (had some vision problems), and I couldn't understand how his diagnosis was so good either, considering what I've been eating. 

I'm currently on 1000mg of Metformin, 4mg of Glimepiride, and and the standard dose of Rybelsus (which is a semaglutide and i think the key to my success), daily. I eat pretty much what I want, within reason, though the key is that I just don't want anywhere near as much as I used to when I eat. I go for a short walk in the evening but that's all I've been doing for exercise. 

I was dreading this appointment so much, but turns out I'm doing just fine.

You leave out lots of other important information.\n\nIf you are eating a decent to high amount of carbs (in my experience, anything over 30-50 grams per day), then the metformin helps to remove that glucose from the blood stream.  However, if you are eating keto, and have been for a while, and don‚Äôt have much glucose in the blood stream, then the metformin suppresses your body‚Äôs natural ability to release some glucose from the liver in order to keep your blood sugar at safe levels.  If you are on metformin, but you also go keto and eat less than 20 carbs a day, then the metformin can push you artificially low and make you sick.  I have experienced this many times until I learned that you don‚Äôt want to mix metformin and keto.  Do one or the other.\n\nAlso, for long term health benefits, you *want* the glucose released from your liver, as long as you aren‚Äôt eating too many carbs and putting excess glucose back *in* your liver.  Diabetes type 2 is generally caused when you‚Äôve eaten so many carbs (while being genetically predisposed) that your liver has started to store excess glucose in the liver itself, giving you fatty liver, and eventually damaging your beta cells.  If you go keto for a long time, (adding in intermittent fasting helps too), then over time the liver will release its excess glucose into the bloodstream, and will become less and less fatty.  If your liver stops being fatty, then it will stop doing any further damage to your beta cells.  So while you still may have diabetes type 2, you will at least stop making it worse.\n\nIf you don‚Äôt believe me, just try it for yourself.  Get a CGM and test your blood sugar on a regular basis on keto, on metformin, and on both.

So i did an A1C test..,"Came in at all time low 4.8! (since i started testing at diagnosis a couple years ago)

I am dealing with a kidney stone which is not causing any pain yet but in the process to find that out, i had a CT scan. 2 years ago i had bad fatty liver with a lesion. Fat on my pancreas as well. In my new scan, both of those have completely resolved.

They say, you can only restore beta cell function by resolving those issues combined with catching it early. I think i have. Now, i have one more blind spot i need to get checked and that is my fasting insulin. I'm going to ask for that at my physical in a couple months.

This 4.8 A1C covers a period of time that included a one week cruise where i abandoned my keto diet and did not do IF. I did not eat as much as I would have prediagnosis but i did indulge. Breakfast, lunch, dinner. I had biscuits & gravy, bread with dinner and desserts as well as alcohol every day. We also had two days in New Orleans where i had everything you would want to try in cajun/creole cuisine. Nothing spiked me. My highest post dinner reading was 129 and it quickly plummeted.

I know the word ""cure"" is extremely divisive here but i'm choosing to believe it's possible. I worked very hard over the past two years. Lost 60lbs (now 180lbs - 6'3"" tall). I'm mostly strict with my diet, exercise and IF but it is not a challenge to me anymore. I actually really enjoy this lifestyle so this can and will be sustainable for me. I was totally expecting my A1C to be in normal range but i expected elevation after 10 days of indulgence. Like something like a 5.3 or 5.4.

I'm really just wondering a couple things. Did i cure myself? Or was i possibly misdiagnosed? Can you have high A1C (9.1 at diagnosis) and not be diabetic?
